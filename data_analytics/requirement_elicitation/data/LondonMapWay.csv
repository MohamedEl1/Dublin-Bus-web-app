0,Karl Smith,1,"May 14, 2020",1,"As a previous user of the Bus Times app I loved it for it's useful information, so much so that I paid the Â£8 to unlock all features.. unfortunately now the app has had a refresh and they have decided to run it as a subscription service, and all the features I paid to unlock have now been locked again behind their subscription model! To have the same functionality I previously had they want Â£13 off me. And I feel that is totally unacceptable, I paid for this app! Either refund or unlock!"
1,Tony Stark,1,"April 13, 2020",2,"App says there are no buses running today, when other buses are going past."
2,Denise Davidson,5,"May 3, 2020",6,This bus app is very good. I can see when my bus is due
3,Chris Artamonov,1,"March 6, 2020",6,"Cant find a worse app to put long ads in, if you're in a rush and need to check the times, and suddenly an ad pops up lasting 20 seconds. Please sort this ad situation out. Before you start saying you need the revenue from ads, what I'm meaning to say is cut the ads a lot shorter, so people dont miss their buses."
4,Anna Mistry,1,"February 13, 2020",10,"You have to wait 5-30 seconds for an advert every time app opens, can never just check the bus times. It gets extremely frustrating, especially when you are waiting for an irregular bus."
5,Mick Mc,3,"February 27, 2020",0,Very good most of the time. Occasionally gives a 'none due' status for all buses. No reason given.
6,Brenda Codrington,5,"March 12, 2020",3,"I totally enjoy using it, as it tells you how long you have to wait for a bus. I'm so glad to have downloaded it!"
7,Jadedon Meredith,1,"February 25, 2020",4,Too much ads and the bus time is not accurate anymore. The app also says none due when a bus is actually near by
8,bose shola,4,"February 8, 2020",3,"I love using the apps, helps a lot to check bus times"
9,Ross Josh McJosh,2,"April 5, 2020",0,Adverts are annoying
10,Dan Nortey,5,"March 3, 2020",0,Very reliable indeed.
11,Krisztian Borbas,1,"November 25, 2019",7,"Very angry. It was the best app on market when it was new. Loved it - fast, accurate, easy to handle. Now is the worst on market. I can see for the developers the money first. Adds and adds and adds, when the people want to see one thing: when and where the next bus us coming. That WAS the best and qickest app to do it. Now full with adds. Purpose lost. And before you answer, please don't. I will switch to other, free, quicker app - as you are not alone with your app, and not worth pay for it."
12,N Y,1,"December 31, 2019",6,"It used to be a good app, not anymore. 30 seconds ad and cannot skip it. It says no internet connection many times, need to open and close the app. I do not have time to play."
13,J P,2,"December 24, 2019",4,Excessive ads!!! You now have to watch a 30sec ad to use the app with no option to skip. Even You Tube doesn't force that on you. Times are pretty inaccurate too.
14,Philip Harvey,1,"October 13, 2018",4,"This app used to be extremely reliable but ever since the latest update there are so many issues. The biggest issue for me is the 'none due' and no arrival times, defeating the entire objective of the app. Also the 30 second refresh is incredibly annoying, having to back out of a bus stop and enter again is the quickest way to update. Bring back the pull down refresh option and sort out the arrival bugs, until then I'm uninstalling."
15,Jackie Coyle,5,"January 28, 2020",0,Use this alot as use buses to get around for work
16,Sandra Lindo,2,"July 28, 2019",4,"App is very good. But there is one major problem. When a bus stop is closed or a route is on diversion it would be handy for the app to tell us, so we know where we're going before we leave out. Nothing is more frustrating than walking a wasted 10 minutes to the bus stop and finding that the bus stop is closed or the whole route is on diversion. Then you have to walk 20 minutes back onto yourself to get to another route. Fix this major issue and I will give 5 stars."
17,Gabija GirdenytÄ—,1,"March 1, 2019",18,"for new version, doesn't allow to check route without turning location setting on. clicking on certain bus stop doesnt allow to see when it's arriving, as it used to be. i can choose to travel from few different bus stops via different routes, so this new version made it all too complicated. very disappointed, will have to find alternative to this app if it doesn't change back to normal."
18,Joshua Kettle,1,"October 5, 2018",12,"Absolute garbage... The route planner is the worst part. There was this one time where I needed to get from Walthemstow central to Loughton station, and no matter how long i messed with the app, all I got was 2 hour long routes where I needed to change onto three different buses, but theres a 20 Debden bus that goes straight to Loughton in about half an hour! Want to get this app? You're better off just getting on a bus and seeing what happens honestly..."
19,la s,2,"May 7, 2019",4,"Rarely reliable The bus times sometimes don't load on the app for the bus stop I select. At first I thought there were no buses due for a while but then I look at the countdown on the actual bus stop itself and can see bus times showing. When the bus times do show, the times aren't always correct. Eg. Arrival time for bus says due but you select that bus and see it's 4 stops away. Doesn't make sense."
20,Marcus Smullen,1,"November 25, 2019",20,"Advertising is loud and intrusive, interfering with all other apps, also interrupt quick urgent searches for buses, so much so that I have missed several buses waiting on adverts. As you have said you need the advertising money, but should there not be an option to at least mute the sound rather than having to try and turn down the volume before my ears bleed."
21,Richard Baker,1,"December 29, 2019",4,"While this app works, the attitude of the developers is that if you decline to rate the app that they spam you with full screen adverts rather than just the banners."
22,Stefan Jeffrey,1,"April 1, 2019",4,"Used to be a great app but recently I'm unable to see when buses are arriving/departing specific locations. As a result I have had to download a separate app to do this and I'm likely to uninstall Bus Times permanently. Update: Bus Times is working again, but the lapse in service has meant I started using Citymapper instead."
23,Mihai Ritivoiu,1,"November 14, 2019",2,"I've been just asked to review this awful app, and I'll take this opportunity to also delete it. I understand you have to make money somehow, but making me wait up to 14 seconds for an ad, while I'm desperately trying to see the bus times in a hurry is just sadistic. I will switch to one of the other apps showing bus times, which I should have done a long time ago."
24,Lewis Kelly,1,"March 8, 2020",0,It is one thing to have a few ads on but not have them so excessive and at intrusive times that it makes it unfriendly to use is very counterproductive
25,Gaurav Gupta,1,"September 27, 2018",19,Since the last update it has just filled up with AD space and does not let you see any meaningful information. They have purposefully made the fonts on this app so big that you are forced to navigate your way around all the ads that fill up the entire screen. Complete waste now
26,Lven,2,"October 23, 2018",1,"Very unhappy with the last update. Does not show the buses arrival accurately, the font is way too big and not to mention the 30 sec waiting for an automatic refresh is incredibly annoying. App used to be perfect before."
27,Diagnal,1,"September 2, 2019",4,"Very unreliable. Buses that are ""Due"" are usually delayed and buses that are 5 mins away, for example, can refresh 30secs later and be due. There are times when the app states that a bus will not be due for 30mins when there are several before that and other times, that there aren't any buses running at all."
28,Agnes Poma,1,"October 14, 2018",4,"The old app is fare more better than this. Anytime I'm in hurry the app never gives the time due. All the buses will say ""none due"" or the App page goes blank for long time before showing the buses arrival"
29,andrej skotsko,3,"May 2, 2019",1,the app used to be very reliable bit recently it's much more hit and miss. times from Lewisham station for 208 &amp; 136 buses are almost always wrong nowadays. please fix it
30,Sally Bow,5,"November 6, 2019",11,Incredibly useful app! Tells you when buses are due so you can plan your journey effectively and avoid long waits at the bus stop. Also adapts very quickly to your change of location...love it!ðŸ˜
31,Ogero Ovie,5,"December 19, 2019",6,Great app for finding nearby bus stops and countdown to when the bus is arriving.
32,Stamatis Mavrogeorgis,1,"October 17, 2018",1,I don't want to be pestered about switching my location ON! Fix it! I should be able to do a search without constantly being asked to switch my location ON.
33,A Google user,5,"July 31, 2019",25,"very good app, arrivals times , are accurate , are shown when bus stop is tapped in nearby.Missed a bus once, used this and caught the next on a different route, within 3 minutes, extremely helpful, perfect."
34,Anil Kapoor,1,"December 21, 2019",2,Too many advertising. Can't see favourites and Home stops The old Apps was much better Thanks
35,A Google user,1,"October 20, 2018",3,"The update is terrible. Half of the time the app is not working, also too many ads !!!"
36,Neil Flynn,3,"August 14, 2019",1,"in general a really good app although it does get it wrong occasionally, but my main complaint is that i dont appreciate the uber ads when ive paid for pro version."
37,Ken Cole,5,"March 20, 2019",3,"terrible compared to IOS version wilk not find ny stops nearby , goes straight to London!!! NOW U GET A 5 STAR - EVEN BETTER THAN IOS, now thats saying somethin! all credit u have fixed the main problems that concerned me ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ Now dont mess about with it please"
38,Gordon Harris,4,"January 15, 2020",0,Good app but the Benson Beds ad cannot be closed down. It MUST be rremoved.
39,Richard Davidge,4,"May 13, 2019",16,Sometimes bus information inaccurate or not available but mostly I find this app very good and I'm much happier with it than without it.
40,Micheal O,1,"January 26, 2019",3,Just because I dont pay for no ad's doesn't mean you should flood my phone with unnecessary ads at unnecessary times. I just need a bust time for punctuality. I don't even click on it and it takes me to another link ðŸ˜¡.
41,Hary S,1,"February 16, 2020",0,"Too many ads , for what this does it's silly,plenty of ad free alternatives"
42,Amanda Roth,5,"May 27, 2020",0,Great app for helping me find out when the next bus arrives
43,Paul Watkins,2,"October 7, 2018",1,I prefer the old app because it was much better to understand and more reliable and gave more information when the buses are due
44,Juliet Kika,5,"November 14, 2019",11,"Really easy to get around,when you have an idea when the bus is gonna come,am happy for that, good job app"
45,Junior Castillo,1,"April 13, 2019",1,As soon as Ads where added to this application it went down the drain. Too busy trying to show me an add than the Information I require. Enjoy the money tho ðŸ‘ðŸ½.
46,Tom Vincent,1,"June 29, 2019",1,"Will regularly say ""none due"" for buses that are running as usual. Completely unreliable."
47,Carl Keszei,1,"October 21, 2019",1,This has stopped working and shows all buses as none due. It was great when it worked.
48,Charmaine Bannerman,1,"September 20, 2018",3,The bus times are hugely inaccurate. There are plenty of other apps which are more up to date
49,Francis Babayemi,5,"January 22, 2019",0,"Excellent, clean, intuitive, real-time bus journey planner."
50,Lulu Rutherford,2,"April 24, 2019",0,Only 2 upcoming buses since an update isn't enough as I have two directions I could go. tonight missed another bus so switching apps as if I'd known the gap I'd have gone the other way.
51,samurai soldier,5,"September 3, 2019",1,"Amazing updates all the time very helpfull and helped me and my drwind arrive to school on time.,ðŸ‘ðŸ¼ðŸ‘ŒðŸ¼"
52,James Weston,2,"March 22, 2019",0,used to work fine but now just a map with no stops or information on buses dont know whqts wrong.
53,Selina Blay,5,"August 4, 2019",3,it helps me plan my journey meticulously without any hassle. ln fact l enjoy riding on the bus to work every day. Excellent
54,Dawn of the Dad,5,"November 1, 2019",0,Does what it says. Adverts are intrusive but easily skipped.
55,Th M,1,"March 27, 2019",2,"Bloated with ads. Shame, because it worked so well before"
56,_Undefined NaN,1,"January 17, 2019",2,This crappy app used 2 GB of mobile data in one month all because of malicious video and image ads. Absolute garbage.

58,Yacob Degal,5,"December 8, 2019",2,Got the to the bus stop on time every time. So glad i found out about this app you know it is very useful.
59,Kameswararao Ravinuthala,1,"May 13, 2019",1,actual bus time never natches what the app shows for bus no 302. also though bus is due as per app and bus is present at starting point we have to wait10 to 15 mins more than due time
60,Kevin Dunn,1,"November 21, 2019",0,Changed timetable on 433 not reflected in live timings.

160,Ammir Chughtai,1,"December 8, 2019",2,Even with WIFI on and location it still does not bring up the times. Im lucky if it does hence 2 stars. To follow on since you have sold your soul to the devil and increase the ads all I get are ads and the actual app doesnt even work. Hence drop to 1 star.
161,Philip Jackson,1,"December 26, 2019",3,Pointless app now outdated by integration with Google maps. The information you get from the app TFL provide freely to anyone who wants it and while they do have to make the app and host it you can get all the information in Google maps making this obsolete. Especially as you don't have to sit through any ads on there. It's incredibly frustrating when you want to quickly open the app to decide to get the bud coming or wait for another to be presented with a 30 second ad just use Google maps
162,Ray Hudson,1,"December 29, 2019",1,"Don't pay for this app. Far too often every bus is shown as ""none due"" when in fact there are several within the time window. Why can't they sort this out?"

It also gives you the registration number of the bus as well. Times of buses generally correct. Much better than other apps I have used. Shame other bus apps are not as good for non London routes. Bus stop letters are shown - very useful if you have to get off train and use bus. Planner though does not work.

(review on 17/8/2018) The new update has downgraded the user interface. Note that, this app is for mobiles, not desktop. To use large icons + half screen ads makes least sense. Please revert to old UI, it was the best. Another thing, try citymapper app, check the features and the no. of persistant ads and decide yourself.

on a route based on destination. I go by picking the bus I like and might 
end up on a different route and destination. Not everyone travel with a 
fixed destination and ETA of the FIRST bus that comes is not the only thing 
for bus rides. There might be a second bus that I want to know about the 
bus type that comes just a minute later. Would have rated it a 10 star if I

353,Mazza Baksmaty,5,"November 8, 2017",8,"This is an efficient app collating several functions in 1 place. Able to set a home stop as well as ""favourite"" most used stops. The journey planner is useful and gives several options in regards to travelling to specific locations.  The nearby function is great as it helps if you are in a location never journeyed to before. Being able to specify a particular route is also useful. I use on a daily basis and has not failed to provide the info I need."

373,Kingsley Li,4,"September 30, 2017",11,Gr8 app. Means I'm not hanging around waiting at the bus wondering when the next bus is due. Especially now that most stops no longer have a schedual board. Downside is working out which direction the stop services.
374,A Google user,5,"September 27, 2017",6,"As long as you can connect to the server when you need to, this is pretty reliable. Very occasionally a bus route doesn't appear when it should be there.

438,A Google user,2,"July 4, 2017",3,Stupid number of ads just stops you using it and becomes annoying. Not always accurate and slow at times. There are better out there.
439,Esther Owolabip,4,"July 10, 2017",0,The app us nit always reliable especially when there's disruption to buses within the estate. It takes times to know when 225 route is suspended.

441,E,4,"July 3, 2017",0,Like the app ads no bother for me but would buy the app if it was a problem. Easy and quick to use. You could teach TFL a thing or two about a simple bus app
442,A Google user,2,"July 6, 2017",0,Rubbish app - one day it shows where you are located at direct time as you open the app and displays bus stop locations in your area so you can choose a bus stop location m for your journey. But then other days it does the complete opposite and the page can't load up your direct location or /display any bus locations noy even where you are at an exact moment.
443,Jalal Maqdisi,2,"July 14, 2017",0,I'm paid unstratified customer. Either wrong bus countdown or absolutely nothing but uber commercial.

446,Rajeswari Sudhakar,2,"July 14, 2017",0,The app works well. However the bus timing is far from accurate. It's not clear of its an issue with the app or the data store from where the app fetches the data.

Would be great to be able to set an alarm to say a bus will be at a certain stop in x amount of minutes (e.g. I could enter that it takes me 5 minutes to walk to my bus stop, and say I need to be on a bus by 8.30 by the latest, and I could be notified to leave accordingly, adjusting for expected delays etc)."
461,Sally Bremner,2,"June 1, 2017",9,Liked this app... Although it  can be temperamental and doesn't always load very quickly. Then I got a 60 second political party message as an ad. Have subsequently deleted the app.
462,Beverley Beckford,4,"June 23, 2017",0,I don't always use it because of the ads. Especially when you have to wait for them to finish before you can get bus info.
463,Krishna Vaddadi,2,"June 18, 2017",0,Not pin pointing bus stops properly. Its preferable that just like tfl app points out stations this app is expected to spot bus stops

477,Aled Lumley,1,"May 18, 2017",2,"App is OK for checking bus times. It is buggy and has caused a variety of problems and regular full page ads. A few days ago it presented a long list of T&amp;Cs to agree to for a range of permissions to steal my data and contacts and share it with anyone in the world, including ""in places not compatible with EU law"" ?? I said no because I didn't trust the wording, nor advertising executives, who are probably lining up marketing e-mail spam."

Picture this, you're in a rush, heading out the door trying to pop into your favourite stops to see when the bus is due. You're forced to watch a full video first. Then constantly asked to turn on your location. Even though you don't need it because you simply want to check a stop you've already saved. I understand the need to advertise but this compromises the usability of the app..Get London bus pal app instead."

528,Elek Urban,1,"April 3, 2017",0,Terrible. Have tried this three times now in different parts of London at different times for different journeys and it's hopeless.  It's currently telling me to walk around Leamouth for 23 minutes before catching the wrong bus  and getting out 15 minutes from where i want to get to...when I know I can get a bus from here (canning town station) to where I need to go. Very badly written.

548,Caroline Fyneface,4,"February 28, 2017",2,"It's a very good app but it really needs to be updated. Like the 157 route is still wrong. It doesn't have West Croydon Bus Station on it so I can't put it as my favourite stop. I can only access West Croydon Bus Station if I'm close to it and by that time I've missed my bus. Please update it monthly and not annually. Apart from that, it's really great and I love using it because it let's me see the number plates and I LOVE number plates. So thank you for that!"
549,Guy Edwards,5,"March 1, 2017",0,"The days of waiting at a bus stop wondering if the bus was even coming are over. It seems a small thing for an app to do, but it makes bus travel much more convenient."
550,Reality Creators,5,"March 1, 2017",0,Good app generally but sometimes it doesn't show certain bus stops when you desperately need it to so you end running to the bus stop without knowing what time the bus is coming.. but it's a nice app

560,A Google user,3,"January 21, 2017",7,"Nice app that does its job well. However there are some issues. For one, the popup for toggling location persistently comes up, even if I don't want to use location. There should really really be an option to disable it, as it is incredibly annoying - please do so. In addition I am not interested in Uber, and have also paid for the premium version, and so if possible I'd like to remove the adverts for Uber too. With these small changes the app would be much much better. But it is still a worthwhile app to use."
561,Mike Urban,2,"February 20, 2017",3,Confusing interface and massively intrusive full screen video ads make this hard to recommend. Shame really because there's some aspects of the app that are rather good
562,Barbara Bernard,4,"February 26, 2017",0,"I have just paid for the ad free version because, although this is a really useful app, the ads are sooo intrusive.  You're rushing for a bus but have to see a long, full screen video before you can get the information you need.  So inappropriate for this type of app.  Another niggle is that the screen doesn't seem to refresh, so you have 8 minutes to get to the bus stop, you check again when you're halfway there and it still shows 8 minutes."

Also, I can check from home, best time to leave for bus stop."

If you close the app and open it again,  they just come back after a couple seconds.                     Edit;    Since posting, this glitch has gone away. The app functions well and, in terms of function, speed and user-friendliness, the best bus app I've come across. Would prefer the in-app purchase to remove ads to be cheaper, as I bought it on Windows Phone for 99p compared to Â£2.99 here, but otherwise good."

808,Andy Aldridge,4,"May 7, 2016",16,This looks good and works pretty well but it's still not the first bus times app I head for. Picking a bus from a bus stop I'd like to know where that bus is not be given bus info for the whole route. The bus icons I guess tell you where the bus is but don't give a hint as to which is the bus I picked or when it will arrive where I am. The last thing being the key info I always want. I'm happy for now to stick with my less beautiful but more friendly app
809,Elliot Barker,3,"April 15, 2016",13,I've had to go back to this app due to the search and bookmark function not being in citymapper.      However I don't like how intrusive the ads now are and they will use up date due to them being videos. Luckily I have unlimited data but there are others that do not.    Its also causing a lot of wakelocks (1000+) with my phone's awake time being 27% because of it. I don't see why it has to keep checking for anything unless it is collecting data.  EDIT: WHY DOES A BUS APP NEED CALENDAR PERMISSIONS?

A few things that would make it better in the jounery planner section would be to have an option where you dont need to put a time of depatures and it simply shows you the routes for the full day allowing you to choose one at your liesure. And the other would be a map view option when choosing a destination. When going to a certain place I am unsure which stop to stop at around it nor do I really know street names.

1014,Laura Swartz,2,"July 24, 2015",1,"Bus London was my favorite app. Recently they have introduced 20 sec videos which can't be stopped (this is in addition to other ads ).  When you are on the go and need to check bus times, this is more than frustrating.  Added to this the app often stops receiving data telling me that there is no bus within 30 mins (from every single route in London!) Afraid it happened again this morning - think I may have to uninstall and pay a small amount for reliability and to ensure that I'm free from pesky ads..."

Example: you open the app,  choose the nearest stops,  zoom, zoom, zoom... Finally you see your stop.  You click on it. You see is coming in 5 mind.  Ok. But you want to check is it going to the right way., so you click on the bus,  you choose which direction (how should I know? ) after you see what are the stops. Please one button,  nearest stops. Show a list and a map or ask which one is better."
