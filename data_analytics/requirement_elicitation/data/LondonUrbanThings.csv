1,Colin Spare,4,"April 1, 2020",1,Good app to use does the job but pop up ads very anoying i dont know why you have these adds on your app there is no need for it and you want to charge to get rid of the adds this is suppose to be a free app remember that.
2,William de Oliveira,5,"February 25, 2020",2,Amazing. Easy to use and full of interesting features...
3,Daniel Simmons,5,"March 28, 2020",1,Very useful app to check local bus times
4,Dhirendra Parmar,5,"March 23, 2020",0,"Good, easy and precise infirmation"
5,olga Spencer,5,"February 22, 2020",4,Love this app. Use it every time I travel. I use it for work and it is fantastic. I have never missed my bus and it saves me waiting at the bus stop for long periods of time.
6,Adam,1,"February 15, 2019",19,"Used to be such a good solid app, now it's almost unusable. The widget hardly ever works, it just freezes when you tap it or try to switch between favourites. Even going into the app to view bus times doesn't work all the time, it just hangs without displaying times. Unless an update is released to fix the problems I'll have to use another app."
7,Precious M,1,"February 28, 2019",2,"Yep have to agree with others. Have used this app for over 3/4 years and is usually extremely reliable, but if the issue with the widget isn't resolved shortly, as its been off and on like this for a while (most of February). I'll have to uninstall as it is no longer reliable."
8,Isaac Cummins,2,"January 24, 2020",4,Was a great app but the widget does not work any longer. Might be android version 10 issue but it is the only reason I have the app and paid for ad removal.
9,Michou Haroliyk,1,"June 6, 2019",4,"The widget tries to populate the list at every touch... Even if you are flicking through a bunch of stops to get to the one you need. The result of this lazy programming is delays and crashes. Worse: I paid for this app years ago, now they want me to pay again! Cannot recommend."
10,A Google user,2,"November 30, 2018",3,"Most bus stops in Stratford Bus Station have changed more than 6 months ago, but your app still shows the last year's layout. For example, D8 departures for Crossharbour is shown to be on Stop C ! This has not been the case for more than 6 months already! Do you ever update?"
11,Ben Arthurs,1,"July 12, 2019",2,"The app would be great if it wasnt for the giant bar down the left hand side of the screen that serves no purpose, the banner at the top and the button telling me to zoom in (well, d'uh on that one) that reduce the map size to 1/4 of my phones screen. The london transport website is easier to use on phone than this app."
12,Sophia Hussain,3,"September 27, 2018",1,"This app is good, but one thing really, really annoys me. Everytime I open this app, it tells me to turn on my location, even though I have it on and it doesn't have the 'never ask again' option. Other than that it works perfectly fine, but I have uninstalled it."
13,Daniel Male,1,"May 24, 2019",2,widget doesn't work !!! has always worked on older phones but since upgrading to a galaxy s7 no favourites appear on the widget. I emailed the support address months ago and never received a reply. this was my favourite app/widget combo but now it's a 1 star in afraid !! unless this prompts some customer service I would not recommend.
14,AndreaJ Claydon,5,"June 9, 2019",7,Very useful at bus stops where there is not electronic signage to indicate how long the wait for the bus will be and whether it is worth waiting for a bus in poor weather or if it is best to start walking when the required destination is only a couple of stops and the bus is going to be delayed.
15,Brenda Sawyerr,5,"March 25, 2020",0,Really handy for planning your journey
16,Barry Collins,2,"November 5, 2019",2,"App is getting unreliable. 3 short stops at the start of my journey. 1 says no buses, another says bus in 3 minutes and another says 20 minutes. This happens all the time. Uninstalling and not using until it's resolved. Shame because I've used this app for years."
17,Gordon Edison,3,"February 23, 2020",1,Widget stopped working. Latest firmware means the widget not working properly. Tapping opens the app where it should update info. Favourites selector the same?
18,maaen,5,"January 20, 2019",1,I have been using this app for a few years now and apart from a few occasions it has served me very well...HATS OFF TO THE ORIGINATOR. It is serving the Transport system of London in the best possible way and I am sure it will evolve even more in the future.
19,A Google user,1,"February 2, 2020",2,Used this a lot but now widget is blank and just takes you to main app page when trying to refresh widget...since latest Android 10 update to One UI v2.0
20,A Google user,5,"June 3, 2019",4,"This is invaluable to me. I can leave home at the right time and not waste time at bus stops. i use the favourites feature a lot. It also gives up to date information about my local trains, which was an unexpected bonus."
21,Bola Adelakun,1,"February 26, 2019",2,Used to love this app but the widget no longer works so I have to go ALLLLLL the way into the app to find out when the next bus is. Irritating when you're in a rush. Fix the widget and I'll give you 5 stars.
22,Joanna Lam,1,"April 15, 2019",2,After the update the widget no longer works and just comes up blank and can'tbe resized?? Clearly not working on all devices!! Please fix this as this would normally be a 5 star rating!
23,Nicola Mitton,2,"February 13, 2019",1,Ive used this app for years and its been great. its normally so good but lately the timing is off. which basically means is doesnt work because that is its only job. please sort it out. i have the latest version.
24,Colin Putnam,3,"November 27, 2018",2,"The latest update says widget and bugs fixed. This is incorrect because the widget does not show my favourite bus stops and is completely blank, please fix asap. Apart from the widget problem the app is good."
25,QwentyJ,4,"January 17, 2019",1,"96 times out of 100, this app is accurate. Invaluable if you need to keep a constant eye on bus times, especially in London"
26,Peter Eversden,4,"September 19, 2019",1,It gives train times as well as bus times from near to where you are. The timings seem to be more accurate than in other apps.
27,Nikki de Vos,1,"October 30, 2019",0,"I have used this app for a long time and it has always been brilliant until now. Every time I go to look at a bus route, it closes. Very annoying!"
28,RC P,3,"November 29, 2018",1,"Not accurate anymore, quite often app shows a time for the next bus, e.g 5 minutes, then you see a bus arrive a minute later or worse after 10-12 minutes."
29,step rydz,1,"February 12, 2019",2,"This app has an awful way of pushing full screen commercials on your mobile, with tiny and ever moving x button to get rid off adverts. Super annoying."
30,jimmy tran,4,"May 13, 2019",2,"incredibly useful, and no this isnt a bot review i like the app (only thinf stopping me from giving it five stars is probs the frequent ads"
31,A Google user,3,"March 28, 2019",0,This app has been great up until last week but now it just keeps refreshing over and over again so now got a different app which works just as well.
32,carole warner,5,"November 30, 2019",9,"I use London bus checker alot, great if you are going out, because you dont need to leave untill bus is due, no hanging around for buses anymore."
33,Mufutau Gbadamosi,5,"November 21, 2018",0,A good app. Would be great to be able to share and link to a child's phone to know which bus they are on!
34,Jennifer Saul,4,"September 21, 2019",1,Usually almost always on point. Works on 'TFL time' which I guess is 1-2mins behind everyone else's reality. Would recommend
35,rita sharma,5,"June 6, 2019",0,"London bus checker is brilliant. can check bus times, route and stops. Very very useful"
36,SHAVINDRA AGGARWAL,5,"January 18, 2019",0,Using this app from few months now. Very accurate in bus timings. Definitely far reliable than google maps.
37,Pat Holley,1,"July 16, 2019",0,Poor Accuracy Increasingly the buses are not arriving. Local changes to bus frequency and cancellations make this app redundant.
38,Peter Oliver,5,"May 26, 2019",0,Very useful app when travelling around London - I use the buses a fair bit so it's really handy and usually pretty reliable
39,Phil Williams,4,"June 22, 2019",0,"Invaluable app, used many times every day. Shame the individual bus stop photos have disappeared though....."
40,Shailender Singh Reyatt,2,"November 14, 2019",1,Does not refresh on time . Timings are way out at times and we miss buses accordingly.
41,F Jay,3,"November 25, 2019",0,Helpful but cld be much better in terms of directional finding and how to get there by various means.
42,Sol Anwar,5,"December 10, 2018",0,"I rely on this app now, it's part of my daily life. That's as strong a review as I can give thank you developers, great work."
43,George Prins,5,"October 31, 2018",0,This is excellent I use it every time I am about to leave the house to judge how long I will have to wait for the bus.
44,Somuj Ali,5,"April 19, 2019",0,it's a great app to use to get around &amp; plan your travels don't get lost or misplaced your bus good luck people
45,mumty mum,4,"May 31, 2019",0,Often reliable. Occasionally has been incorrect but usually good.
46,Chiara B,1,"December 4, 2018",0,"Accurate within 5 minutes, which is pretty useless for London"
47,Michael Martin,3,"October 25, 2018",2,Not very accurate re times. Just been passed by the bus I need that will be here in 5 minutes. Will delete and go back to wait and see.
48,Vinh Luong,2,"August 14, 2019",0,doesn't work in the early mornings. no times in the early mornings. most of the time inaccurate. only good during day time.

52,Abraham Spring,3,"November 28, 2018",0,"Hello, I purchased this app some years ago and I'm getting ads now, can you please sort this out."
53,Ken Driscoll,5,"October 24, 2018",0,"Works well and easy to use, best bus app I have found out of several others"
54,Menassa George,5,"March 22, 2019",2,"as a bus stop is exactly opposite our house, i always check when the next 267 or the110 will be coming and seconds before they are due i make a dash towards the bus stop and happily board it upon arrival"
55,A Google user,5,"March 26, 2019",0,really useful when there is no electronic advice.
56,A Google user,2,"December 9, 2018",0,Not working any longer. No times and wrong bus information. Goodbye.

after an hour I call tfl and they tell me no busses are stopping there 
because of evening work.. waste of time if it cant provide accurate data... 
pity there isnt an option lower than 1 star... id like to see these 
developers stuck waiting for a night bus that never arrives"
213,Kyz Bourne,2,"July 6, 2018",0,"Sometimes it's good but all that ""nothing expected "" rubbish has allowed

216,Milena Nikolaeva,5,"May 22, 2018",0,"I've been using the app the last two years and was working like a charm. 
Updated yesterday and since then its not showing anything. On the place of 
the map, there's a message ""Google Play services updating"" and that's it. I 
reinstalled twice - nothing. Gave it a good 10 minutes to ""update"" - still 
nothing. Please fix it! Edit: Fixed. Working like a charm again. Deserves

241,A Google user,5,"July 20, 2017",11,"This app is amazing! Makes travelling around London easy for anyone. The built in journey planner is very good and the bus and train times are accurate. The only flaw I have noticed is with the widget. For underground stations, the widget only shows the trains going from one of the platforms. For railway stations, the widget only shows departures (This isn't as big an issue as the underground stations). Regardless of this flaw, the app deserves 5 stars. It would be even better if this could be fixed."
242,Nikki,2,"January 3, 2018",6,This app used to be really good but recently it's become less reliable and the widget never loads when you tap to refresh or will sometimes show you out of date info. I rely on the widget daily so this has become really annoying. I have a brand new pixel 2 which is fully up to date and full reception of 4g data so it has got to be the app that's the problem. This has only been a problem since the last update.
243,Fadma El Jalaoui,5,"July 5, 2017",10,I normally hate bus apps because they freeze and give you the wrong information. This one is great it tells you all the stops around where you are the next buses per stops with updated time etc...
244,theycallmemrglass,5,"May 8, 2017",6,Very user friendly and fully feature. Including favouriting bus stops.  So useful for bus stops that have no digital displays.  And i can determine if i have time to nip into a shop and get a snack before my next bus arrives.
245,Sandeepan,3,"October 19, 2017",0,"Used to be a great app, but not anymore. The widget is often unresponsive and doesn't refresh, which  defeats the purpose of the app. I now have to go into the app, search for the bus stop and check the bus time, which I could do on Google maps."
246,Karen Valle,4,"March 3, 2018",0,Great app... But it says you can sync saved favourites... But then it didnt work?  So now all my favourites are gone! Can anyone help me out?
247,Dench Taduyo,5,"March 10, 2018",0,"If you are a Londoner who takes public transport to many different places that you have never been to before, i suggest this app. Google maps just cant compete with its journey planning capability.   ðŸ‘ŒðŸ¼"
248,Evangeline Liew,2,"March 5, 2018",1,What happened? This app is freezing and restarting every single time I click on a bus stop or mapping a journey. I'm using it on an S7 and all software are up to date.
249,A Google user,2,"July 22, 2017",1,It so often doesn't work. Very frustrating when you are waiting and watching the minutes count down then when it says your bus is 1 minute away it suddenly jumps back to 10 minutes away.
250,Edward Hogg,5,"July 21, 2017",0,Very useful. Fills the gap left by TFL's inconsistent and broken signage. The active bus stop icons could be larger/zoom easier.
251,TomÃ¡s,2,"February 22, 2018",2,"This app helped me immeasurably for a year or so. But then, widget stopped working, app crashed randomly and worst of all bus times were unreliable. Sadly had to uninstall."
252,A Google user,2,"December 21, 2017",1,"Was always my go to app for bus times, but recently it just crashes all the time after about a minute.  I've switched to an alternative app now"
253,Debbie Coombs,5,"April 27, 2017",7,I use this daily. Very reliably tells me when buses are arriving. Great for timing when to leave to avoid  hanging around at bus stops.
254,s q,2,"December 31, 2017",2,I've paid for this app before but for some reason I have to pay again to have the premium version. App is very unstable. Airways crashes
255,Sean Gillen,1,"January 18, 2018",1,"Used to be great but recently the arrival times are inaccurate, consistently up to five minutes out. Could you offer a solution?"
256,A Google user,2,"August 20, 2017",1,Not accurate times anymore sadly. Plus a huge ad for travel to Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. Not cool.
257,Kevin Greedary,4,"March 1, 2018",0,"Been using this app since 2011, and purchased the paid version in 2012. Little did I know the devs would dupe their long standing customers like this. I emailed my proof of purchase last week and got no response. I'm having to use the free version and I'm having to pay again for an app I already purchased before to get rid of the ads. What to do, I guess this was their intention of getting rid of the paid version of the app, to force users to pay for it again."
258,Yoana Kirova,2,"January 6, 2018",4,It crashes every 2 min after the last updates!! I have to open it over and over again! Fix it please!
259,Richard G,3,"January 10, 2018",1,No problems at all till now but have downgraded as  widget for south ealing tube still only shows one direction. Told them ages ago
260,Kuldeep Sehra,5,"July 16, 2017",1,This app is wonderful I can't commend it enough it does what it's supposed to and I'm very pleased with it even out of the areas it works as well thank you
261,Jose SJD,4,"July 20, 2017",0,"First time using it and it was useful. You need Internet connection to make it work. It would be nice to have a better location searching tool, as I had to manually move the destination point multiple times. Nevertheless, I would recommend it if it didn't have such massive amounts of adverts."
262,Rob te Brake,4,"August 4, 2017",0,"Good app, very useful. A tip for the designer: It would be even better if the widget would automatically show  the closest favorite bus stop (as I have more than 5). It saves me from scrolling back or forth to the right bus stop."
263,A Google user,2,"March 4, 2018",1,"I paid for the the app but on a new phone it ignores that and gives me ads, can this be changed?"
264,Ravia Nessa,5,"November 20, 2017",1,"Its a very useful App! I use it everyday before heading to the busstop. Gives accurate timing. What I like most about this App is the design, layout and info is very easy and to use! Amazing App!"
265,La Pidd,2,"December 15, 2017",2,Inaccurate and pops an ad in your face every time you check for your bus. Garbage.
266,Regis Burathoki,1,"February 12, 2018",2,Used to be a great app until recent update . All it does now is crash over and over. Isn't as reliable as it used to be.
267,A Google user,4,"September 10, 2017",1,Very reliable and user friendly. To my knowledge doesn't give warnings if there's route changes on buses which would be useful.
268,Tarlton Parsons,3,"November 27, 2017",0,"Shows ""phantom"" buses that disappear just before they are supposed to arrive and shows bus still three or four minutes away when it arrives."

272,Susan Chapple,5,"July 28, 2017",0,Timetables fine when it works other than that it's not too bad  the 54 bus timetable is not working on mobiles did not work all day yesterday indoors or outdoors can you explain why thank you
273,Gerard C,5,"July 19, 2017",1,Works well and gives me the info I need clearly
274,Michael Garrett,1,"January 26, 2018",2,Crashes all the time. Otherwise it would be good
275,Kenny,2,"January 26, 2018",2,Excessive crashing. Have uninstalled and reinstalled to no avail.

280,Paul Landers,5,"July 26, 2017",1,Very easy to use and I've found it very accurate apart from peak traffic. Prefer it to the TFL equivalent.
281,Juned Islam,5,"January 22, 2018",1,I have been using this app for 6 years and have to say it is the best. Developers are really helpful too
282,D Mensah,3,"January 8, 2018",1,Was the best up until the new year when it started crashing and stopped loading bus times
283,Leith L,2,"February 16, 2018",1,Started good but now crashes more than anything I know. Going to uninstall.
284,Ese D,5,"September 21, 2017",1,This is a good app but would be better if you could use it without wifi

365,Richard Jones,1,"February 11, 2017",3,"Potentially this could be a great app. However, it is not always clear how to set it up and the instructions are useless. I spent over an hour trying unsuccessfully to delete/change my home address. When I contacted Urban Things I was told it is not possible to do this. If you enjoy fiddling around, going down blind alleys and wasting time, this is the app for you. Otherwise, it is best avoided."
366,Time Teller,5,"April 9, 2017",4,"So on reflection to my first review ...I believe I under rated a perfect score.  I reside in London and find this app a cherished possession if like me you rely on the transport system to go out and about.  This has never let me down....it's always be 100% accurate and I am not sure what would do without it. Once you have figured out how to use it (I suggest you sit and discover when your not busy) it's a very straight forward and accurate app.  For me...if I could give more stars I would, definately ðŸ‘"
367,Anthony Dark,1,"March 12, 2017",2,Too unreliable to use! Doesn't refresh properly and display the correct information meaning you miss buses all the time. As poor a service as TFL.
368,Matt L,3,"February 9, 2017",6,"Have to keep shutting in application manager after I close the app itself, otherwise it drains the phone battery. Would be good if this was improved."
369,vicky hunt,4,"March 26, 2017",0,I love this app. I always find it works spot on. I use it for myself and also to tell my daughter when the bus is near for her journey home from college. Saves hanging around in the rain.   Vicky

I have addressed this before with no proper understanding, feedback or consideration. It's not much to ask. The pink look is quite ugly for me.

The screen remains blank while the ""Getting your location"" message stays up. Worse than useless. Sort it out, please. I'm on the verge of uninstalling because it is so useless."
412,Panda W,5,"December 12, 2016",10,"Overall I am very happy with this app,  and am very glad that I paid for the ad-free version. Sometimes it helps me to save time by going for an alternative bus if my usual bus is badly delayed. I did have a problem a few days ago when it said there were no buses due,  but the SMS service on the bus stop also said there were no buses due so I knew the problem was not with the app. I still need to find my way around a bit more, but I'm so glad that I have it."
413,Alison R,3,"December 22, 2016",3,Archway Station buses have all changed but this has not been updated. The directions will tell you to use the old bus stops but you click on them and the info has been cancelled as the bus stops are no longer in use but the app has not added the new stops so no information is available. *thanks for your reply fingers crossed it is updated soon as currently the info given on here is incorrect...sadly making the app unusable

Oh I can see a bus in the distance, it's not  the one I want so I carry on trying to find the road on my small mobile screen.  I give up and download a better app.   I now have an app that gives me the destination, the  bus number and how long it is away from where I am, without any faffing around.

If you don't know what I mean: On the bus stands it says in the morning when the bus normally comes. It would make more sense if you could plan the journey from the previous day instead of waiting for the dying second to check it.

To those who are having problems with timings I have found that when near a bus station the app has to revert to the planned timetable, if the buses are running late then the station has not released them then the data can not be live. Once released then the telemetry takes over and you have acuret timings."
879,Steve Sholl,5,"October 31, 2015",1,"I'm a bus driver, so this app is really useful for me. Tried several bus information apps before settling on this one. It's simple, it works, you can get it free, but for just Â£2.99 you can have it without the ads. Great value. Other reviewers have found the app 'constantly wrong'. 'Often wrong' might be more accurate, and that is just a feature of the 'flaky' TFL iBus system that provides the data feed for this, and all other, bus info apps."

It has a map of nearest bus stops. You just tap the bus stop and all buses that go there are flagged up. If you want a particular bus only tap onto the number and you will get information on that bus only. Highly recommended.
960,Steven Dorling,5,"July 12, 2015",0,"If you live in London and use buses I would suggest this app. Does what it says on the tin, does it well and I rarely have problem with it.

That's assuming that the app doesn't crash before I reach that stage though.

1270,Colin Mizzi,5,"December 25, 2014",1,I use this app quite a lot and find out easy to use very intuitive.   I used to spend a not insignificant proportion of my time standing at bus stops for one thing or another but now I can leave my house with just enough time to get to the bus stop as a bus arrives.  The longest I've had to wait since Dowloading this app is about 4 minutes compared to the average waiting time of 10 minutes previously.  A considerable improvement.
1271,Keith Dunnett,2,"July 29, 2014",2,"EDIT: not as reliable as I thought, don't know where they get their data but it doesn't always agree with what's on the TFL site and the app sometimes leaves buses out. Nice when it works but I'm reluctant to rely on it now. Request to rate the app repeats too persistently, maybe nag every five or ten uses rather than consistently, so many users must just say ""never rate""."
1272,Nicholas Doran,3,"October 26, 2014",0,Bus services out of date on routes near my house. Changed over a year ago. Departure data seems to be linked to timetables rather than actually tracking the buses. Nonetheless it is a useful little app.

2112,A Google user,5,"May 2, 2012",0,This is the first app I have reviewed and rated as it is the best app I have used on android. It makes my life a lot more bearable knowing when the next bus is arriving and means I can stay a little later at work where it is nice and warm than waiting outside in the cold. So far this app has been bang on for time of all the buses I use. Definitely a great app to have if you live in London
2113,A Google user,4,"March 15, 2012",0,This is a really good App and I've come rely on this Light version a lot. Crashes on Android 2.3 a bit but restarting the App sorts it out mostly

Another drawback is the lack of the Stop Alert: this is a great feature that allows for the app to notify users as they near their destination stop.
