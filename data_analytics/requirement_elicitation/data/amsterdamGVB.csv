0,A Google user,3,"September 30, 2018",20,Confusing for tourists with tourist tickets that are restricted to lines operated by certain companies. The app doesn't give information about the operators. I ended up with a multi-stop connection where the bus driver refused my ticket and I had to travel back to take a different connection.
1,Ozgur Kalkan,3,"November 19, 2018",4,"It's a good app, more like an essential one, but the trams and trains always change routes and there is always something wrong resulting in me either getting late or not getting there at all."
2,gabs igab,5,"November 7, 2019",2,"Excellent app I have used it on our visit to Amsterdam and was excellent. Great help to have with you. Good info, accurate, reliable. Good planner also."
3,Damian,5,"March 1, 2020",1,It works very well for traveling. I use it everyday.
4,Pel Pan,1,"March 28, 2019",1,very bad accuracy and often not the shortest way
5,Dinesh VG,1,"October 3, 2018",2,Super confusing app!
6,Paulo Waisberg,5,"July 24, 2019",1,We will see so far so good
7,Paul-Peter Theulings,4,"November 28, 2018",5,"Een verbeterpuntje. ""Tap the + button in the bottom right to plan your trip"". Haal dat maar weg en ga meteen door naar de planning, zoals andere reisapps het ook doen."
8,Tom Thomasson,2,"December 14, 2018",0,"Werkt erg counterintuïtief. Als ik de dienstregeling van een specifieke lijn probeer te vinden, deze vervolgens selecteer, dan kan ik deze slechts in 1 richting plannen."
9,A Google user,1,"September 22, 2018",2,Slecht zie te je locatie niet meer waardeloos
10,A Google user,1,"August 25, 2018",2,Doesn't work
11,Florin Fira,1,"January 27, 2018",4,"App crashes, unusable. Cannot log in into my account too. What a waste of time."
12,A Google user,3,"September 25, 2017",7,Version 3.3 is working now after my complaint has been dealt with...
13,A Google user,1,"May 9, 2017",7,Useless. Can not search for stops in the trip planner. Very occasionally a stop shows up but vanishes when next character is typed.
14,John Harig,1,"April 30, 2017",2,This app crashes after a few searches. It states that it cannot download location and it cant find any location in a search. I have to delete and reinstall the app each time. It is laughable how bad this is considering how many developers live in amsterdam.
15,Cenon Del Rosario,1,"March 30, 2017",7,"Very useless app, why is location required and not just search for places? Cannot even offer extensive places when searching, FAIL!"
16,Tom Wahlicht,1,"April 22, 2017",5,"Searching for stops does not work, Autocomplete stops not working as well. Therefore it is pretty much useless"
17,Alexander Dugdale,2,"March 20, 2017",2,Unable to input departure location and destination. App will not search for locations when i type into the search bar
18,Mahdi Abd,1,"September 15, 2017",0,This app doesn't work.... The basic task like list the destination and auto suggestions stations never worked for me
19,Stefan Simon,1,"August 30, 2017",1,"The main feature, planning a trip, does not work because searching for stations shows no results! Fix it ASAP"
20,Marco van Dijk,1,"April 26, 2017",2,No real time departure info for buses
21,A Google user,1,"May 2, 2017",2,The main feature to plan a ride doesn't work. You need to fix it.
22,Ramy Taha,1,"April 16, 2017",2,Doesn't search for station names!!!!! Awful
23,Gaius Octavius,1,"March 9, 2017",0,waardeloze app. niet gebruiksvriendelijk.   Ander app OVinfo; deze werkt veel beter zonder registratie zonder gps.

25,cristian searpe,1,"April 19, 2017",0,Not working!
26,Simon Prosser,1,"December 15, 2015",8,Very slow. 80% of time it doesn't work.  Poor user interface.
27,Leo Tao,5,"April 9, 2016",9,Would be lost without it
28,Anton Hein-Hudson,5,"May 28, 2016",7,I'm impressed with this GVB app and the depth of information available. It is well organized and info is easy to find.  One of the most useful features for me is the fact that it provides real-time departure times.  The app is fast and reliable.
29,Denilson Sá Maia,2,"January 18, 2017",0,"The app might have been useful, if it weren't SO SLOW! You see the rotating circle (indicating ""loading"") everywhere, for every action you do. And it takes too long to finish loading anything (even on Wi-Fi). I spent more time looking at the loading circle than looking at the information I wanted."
