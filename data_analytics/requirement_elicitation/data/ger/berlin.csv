0,Bjorn Thegeby,1,"May 20, 2020",1,It activated all four tickets of a four-ticket purchase at once. I would like to give it a better rating but that has to be fixed!
1,Robin C,5,"June 12, 2020",0,Fantastic and easy to use!
2,Glenn Dobbelaere,1,"January 20, 2020",9,"In Berlin it apparently is only possible to pay your ticket on the tram with change, bills are not accepted by the machine. Why!? We did not have enough change and could not buy a ticket beforehand because it was a small stop without machine. I installed this app to try and buy tickets. I could not find how to buy multiple tickets at the same time, so I tried to buy them separately. When selecting PayPal as payment method, it required me to install Chrome Browser. Why!? We did not buy tickets."
3,Max M.,5,"June 3, 2020",0,"Stable performance on my phone (Samsung Galaxy S7). Useful features, continuous development and updates."
4,Simon Paag,4,"March 31, 2020",7,"It's a decent app. Don't get med wrong, it's not my favorite app, but hey it's a transport app. Not like the new tinder or anything like that, therefore 4 stars."
5,Spiros Daoudakis,3,"December 25, 2019",9,The application is very good but is missing one very useful feature. When you want to purchase a ticket you cannot set the validity time and you are forced to book the tickets a few minutes before you travel and not in advance.
6,mrow,2,"October 17, 2019",27,"I use this app every day. The basic functionality works well, but it is very frustrating that the found routes in the Trip Planner always disappear when the app is closed for a while or when displaying a ticket. I often want to look up at which station I have to change (and on which platform I have to go for the connection, etc.) while I'm on a bus or train already, and it's always gone and I have to repeat the search, which then shows different results because it's a later time. please fix :("
7,Benedict Kalus,2,"April 19, 2019",21,"To start on a positive note, the app is more reliable than Google maps, which is absolutely rubbish in Berlin. However, the BVG app is also pretty useless when you need realtime information, e.g. when services on an underground line are cut. In that case, it showed me, that I should take the line without service with a little warning triangle that trains are actually not going without telling me what actually is going. In general, the app also suggested itenaries with unnecessarily long walks."
8,Christopher Till,2,"September 17, 2018",9,"For the last year I've been using app fine. Last 2 weeks, I've had pre bought tickets magically activate. And missed several s bahns due to connection time out. The one occasion I took the gamble, a ticket inspector took pitty on me after saying there are lots of problems at the moment. Gone old fashioned until the issue is resolved"
9,Roberto Arias Alegria,1,"September 19, 2018",11,"Incorrect charges due to a glitch in their systems and on top of that they want to charge late payments 😡 Put your act together BVG, that never happens in the Apps of major cities. For other users: be careful and try to use pre-paid cards with limited credit. BVG might try to charge you randomly later a then it'll be up to you to fight this with the bank."
10,Katarzyna Bednarz,1,"September 19, 2018",17,"The app is absolut rubbish in the last week or so- l've been charged twice the double amount on the same purchases of a 4-Trip ticket and a 4-short-trip ticket. When I recalled the charges through my bank, I fast immediately got an invoice from Logpay with an invoice for the incorrect amount plus almost 10€ of late fees to pay and my account has been blocked for further usage...! also, they have already charged the correct amounts on another day, so I guess I owe them nothing and i received a vague email from BVG apologising and telling that they are sorry for the technical issues and double bookings, and all is good now, but my account is still blocked and unusable!!!"
11,Pawel R,3,"October 8, 2019",23,New update is bad. Before it worked flawlessly for me. Buying new tickets was fast and even the pre purchased tickets were visible and easy to access. Now it takes forever for them to show up and I have to refresh the app several times and turn off my wifi for it to show up so you can select it. Why did you have to break what worked fine?
12,David Vartanian,3,"October 7, 2019",10,"The UI is getting better. However, the service behind is getting worse. Services are not reliable (sometimes it shows buses coming on time but they don't even come), and it's not possible to report incidents. However, reporting problems via the web form also doesn't make BVG react. Delays, driver's lack of education, services that never came, nothing seems to be taken care of. I'm paying 64 euros per month for mediocrity not compatible with the quality and punctuality Germany promotes abroad."
13,Frank Tinschert,2,"February 4, 2020",6,"Too many steps to buy a ticket, difficult to manage multiple payment methods. No option to start with ticket purchase as home screen. Works ok though."
14,Ryan Walker-Gray,1,"September 17, 2018",16,"This app is magical! You can watch busses evaporate right before your very eyes! Need to get to work? Poof! That bus is gone now! Been waiting at your stop for ten minutes? Wait another ten, the bus on the app was just an illusion! I can't wait to pull off a disappearing act of my own, from Berlin, forever!"
15,Andreas Goedecke,2,"September 17, 2019",6,"App is fine *if* it's actually showing what's happening. With recent construction around Potsdam's S-Bahn, the App is incredibly inaccurate. Either it shows trains that are not running, or it's showing trains that are running normally as canceled. Might be a problem with the database - but it's really not that useful right now."
16,Lorenz RUDKIN,4,"September 17, 2019",9,"For a first test: very well, helped me enormously to make my way thru the ""jungle"". As an only occasional visitor to the city, it was much less hassle free than before. Also great: the pedestrial path to the destination is included! The tutorial is quite condensed, more info would b helpful. But the essentials can be learned fast. Some additional alarms would be desirable tho: - when the goal station is approaching - when the wrong direction is taken (by foot or public transport)"
17,Laura Broenink,4,"October 2, 2019",7,"The email confirmation link does not work (just leads to a 404 Not Found page), yet without confirming your account, you cannot buy tickets. Kind of useless like this :( Update: once I had actually arrived in Germany, I gave it one more try and suddenly I could validate my account. App works decently now. Is it region locked or something? (If so, it would be helpful if it actually says so, instead of these broken links when trying to access from outside Germany...)"
18,Lona Suark,2,"December 21, 2018",57,"the ticket you buy is valid immediately without option for later validation. Not possible to buy tickets for people traveling with you since ticket is personal. App lacks Help files, FAQ and clear instructions! No customer support service and SEPA Direct Debit always rejected. People at BVG offices know nothing about the app. Pathetic."
19,Natd,3,"September 30, 2019",7,"Too many steps to validate the already bought 4 trip tickets. Also, it happens often that you buy the ticket and it takes ages to download. Not useful if you are in a hurry."
20,M K,5,"May 22, 2019",16,"Berlin - a modern metropoly with great public transport, but no ticket machines, and even if you find one, they only accept coins. I couldn't survive without this app. Route planning is also a life saver."
21,Jon Huskell,1,"October 18, 2019",8,"Beware!!! Don't buy tickets through the app! You will lose your money. Tickets get unvalidated after purchase before you can use them. Looks like a big See other users are experiencing same issues I wrote them, they will ignore you and you won't get a refund"
22,Igor Madjeric,1,"January 2, 2020",2,App is unstable most of the time I still have to buy ticket instead of using app because of server issues.
23,oscar sandoval,2,"September 12, 2018",3,The app charges you doble for the tickets. I bought a day ticket and because they take to long in charging you I didn't notice but then I bought a short trip ticket and they did again. So instead of charging 7 euros they charged 14 and the same thing for the short trip ticket
24,Christoph Wurst,1,"November 14, 2019",21,"Tried to purchase tickets, but app didn't accept my password. Regardless of that it charged the amount from my PayPal account. Now the conflict resolution tells me this shouldn't even be possible. Is this a joke? Other people from Berlin know similar stories. Don't use this app."
25,Riyed Rony,5,"May 19, 2020",0,Most daliy usefull apps.One of the best transport system in the world. Happy for service. Keep servicing Berlin.
26,Felix Blind,3,"May 22, 2019",8,it has a very small limit for password length but it doesn't tell you which. makes it very frustrating to set passwords. everything else works fine.
27,Samuel Alder,5,"April 9, 2019",18,"Great app, so useful to be able to buy tickets on my phone instead of standing in line at a machine for them! also more or at least equally accurate to Google maps, great incase that is unusable for any reason thanks for developing it"
28,Leonard Davies,5,"January 22, 2020",3,"Great app for planning integrated transport around Berlin. Trams, bus, s bahn, ubahn and regional,"
29,PC Southworth,2,"November 19, 2019",7,Generally useful but a little hard to navigate. After last update the credit section doesn't show up anymore under tickets which is a major problem. Would have to go to expired tickets first and then to credit to access my credit tickets. Has to be fixed.
30,Eduardo Heinen,5,"December 11, 2019",6,I would love to have the cards to see the transports nearby and how long for them to arrive. iPhone has it and it is awesome. I don't need to open the app to see how long my bus will take to arrive.
31,Norman Blackburn,3,"September 24, 2018",2,Does pretty much as expected. I don't use it to buy tickets so much though. I much prefer the old fashioned way of a physical ticket in my hand.
32,Luther Lebtag,2,"November 4, 2019",2,"Since the last update my credits do not appear properly. It seems the app needs to update before the credits can appear. Not cool, it used to work properly before. Please fix it."
33,Lucas Blume,4,"May 30, 2020",0,Easy and comfortable design.
34,Malcolm Vernon,5,"March 4, 2019",7,Top quality Berlin journey plan and ticket app. Link you card and put start and end adresses and you wont need to figure out the Berlin transport pricing structure. Lovely maps integration means you can do even multimodal journeys like a local
35,Kornel Hoekerd,1,"July 30, 2019",6,"Wow. You can select countries other than German, but it will not accept the postal code no matter how I write it, even does not accept Berlin postal code. So impossible for me to use......."
36,Ognjen Simić,5,"March 6, 2020",2,Super useful and functional! Makes Berlin easy to navigate. 5/5
37,Martin,5,"May 22, 2020",0,"Very much a strong exception to the rule ""Govt. style apps are always awful"""
38,Jonas Frankki,2,"November 20, 2019",1,After update - Tickets take forever to download - almost got a fine though I had bought the ticket in advance - Tickets &amp; Favorites are harder to find Just undo this update please.
39,Menno van der Graaf,4,"February 16, 2020",3,"Interface is sometimes a bit too overwhelming, but man this app can do everything"
40,Tom Bergman,1,"September 20, 2018",1,"This app used to be amazing, but since the new update it is super slow. Constantly 'downloading resources' and timing out 2-3 times before i can activate a ticket"
41,A Google user,4,"March 22, 2019",5,"Very good app, can be fiddly at first, especially when searching for destinations, hence four stars, but otherwise highly recommended."
42,Adam Glover,3,"August 13, 2019",9,"seems to do the same as the ticket app, yet you cant see your purchased tickets in this app, and vice versa. Room for improvement!"
43,Marcos Doellerer,4,"September 17, 2019",5,"Very good, all information available, can make search for recent past, which is useful since it does not save info after block, unblock screen"
44,Nicole Anansi,3,"September 22, 2019",2,Quite ok...but some suggested itineraries forget the most obvious ones...especially of travelling with luggage it's no fun to walk 1 mile when the next bus stop is around the corner
45,Khaled Alaswad,1,"November 6, 2019",4,I don't recommend anyone to buy tickets from this app. I bought online ticket through this app and when the control wanted to check my ticket the app just didn't work then they charged me 60€.
46,Marc LUDWIG,4,"April 16, 2019",1,"Great app. Unfortunately, you can only purchase one single Ticket. No options for additional passenger / familiy members."
47,Sanny Minga,5,"August 12, 2019",6,"Thanks BVG! You can still improve through, in updating the changes faster, during strikes, engine breaks, functional issues for example."
48,Mike Laing,5,"November 16, 2019",8,"Fast, accurate, comprehensive and so easy to use. Doesn't crash or act up....great app!"
49,Anwar Kholid,4,"September 22, 2018",3,"It works very well. Bus schedule is not always correct / on time, but come on......a bus has to compete with other cars."
50,Kristina Gybasova,5,"August 25, 2019",3,"Excellent app. English interface! Shows delays, platforms, allows to buy tickets. Simply brilliant."
51,Khder Omar,2,"November 30, 2018",10,"Some good features but bus times are always confusing ...the bus that never come, the app assumes is on time or delayed ..."

95,A Google user,3,"September 20, 2018",5,"Meh. It'll help you but honestly you're probably better off using Google Maps on public transport mode. By the way, always leave 3-5 earlier than the app tells you to. You'll thank me later."

Außerdem werden oft die simpelsten Verbindungen nicht angezeigt, sodass man sich das dann einzeln raussuchen muss. Und bitte sorgt dafür, dass eure App das anzeigt wenn Ersatzverkehr besteht und eine korrekte Verbindung raussucht. Geht gar nicht morgens vor der Arbeit, mega Frust!"

no issues. I've used the app more than expected and that's only to know 
what bus, tram, U, S or RE/RB number I should take to get from A to B. The 
app is wonderful and there were fairly low delays. Most of them are with 
the buses, but that's to be expected. I dont know why some people rate the 
app lower because it didn't tell a bus was delayed in real time. There are 
more than 200 buses running simultaneously and if a bus loses GPS signal it 
will not be picked up by the app... The buses also depart every 5-20 
minites and that's really good so I don't know why some are complaining.

344,Uta Drescher,2,"November 19, 2017",3,"What bothers me most is that the app doesn't store the connection you found, not even for even five seconds, if you go into another app for a moment, e.g. google maps. Highly annoying as I keep having to look up my conncetion again or take screen shots or write it down, simply because the app can't store it for a few seconds. That's not very user friendly."
345,Suzana Z,3,"November 12, 2017",3,"It is a very useful ap, it gives options for transport to any part of the city. I use it daily, but it really annoys me every time i use it.

346,Andrei Kramer,1,"September 11, 2017",11,"there is no button to tell the app, that it is wrong in rejecting my input. I insist that I know better than the authors of the script that check the postal codes. I live there! also: server errors."

350,Shailja Dubey,2,"July 7, 2017",24,"The app is helpful to check public transport. I have just moved to Berlin from Mumbai, in Mumbai we have app to check all types of public transports operated. The best part of that app is it works offline unlike BVG app which makes it much more convenient to use. Also the m-indicater (Mumbai's app) has special feature for women security. BVG should work on their app to make it user friendly and must introduce security features for women."
351,Coman Hamilton,1,"October 10, 2017",4,"Without warning, the app automatically validates a ticket when being bought, meaning you waste a fare if you don't want to travel yet. BVG customer service is too poor to get money refunded."

424,A Google user,1,"March 5, 2017",47,"Very unreliable, fails randomly. And when it does, it may entitle you to a significant penalty fee, no excuses accepted. It should work flawlessly. Payments don't go though (just sometimes), app crashes, it logs you out occasionally.."
425,Valeria Wagner,1,"March 5, 2017",10,"App doesn't work after update. Tickets are not shown inside the app. Now, I can't buy it at all. What does format error after payment confirmation mean?  It is not pretty clear for user."

456,Ovidiu Croitoru,1,"February 15, 2017",2,"Extremely dumb update where the location where the ticket becomes valid can no longer be chosen! I ended up waiting for minutes to get a ticket and I still haven't managed to get one. Also, BVG dummies... location doesn't work in Ubahn (underground)!"
457,Abouzar Hosseini,3,"February 7, 2017",4,"Opening other apps and switching back to it cause it to restart and lose searched routes.

458,Pavel Logacev,1,"February 17, 2017",0,"The app fails to download purchased tickets or even show them in the purchase history. As a result I ended up buying five tickets for a single trip, and, of course, none of them are being displayed."

Cannot switch language to DE, am stuck with my phone's locale and the EN localization is comically poor. Overall the app seems cluttered and impractical. Frequent FCs. I'd much rather keep using DB Navigator for connections, but I want those mobile tickets."
463,Andreas F,2,"September 9, 2016",16,"The sign up process already sucks. No autocomplete/predictions enabled in the input fields. You do not really recognize, that you should check your emails, the form just keeps displayed. The mail contains a link that isn't clickable, the page that opens asks you for a start / stop location for a trip (though it confirmed your mail in the background apparently). Setting up a payment method seems only possible by ""almost"" purchasing a ticket at the same time. Whitespace in Iban / BIC do not get trimmed.. Etc."
464,Paweł Polański,1,"December 30, 2016",6,"The app keeps on improving and I like to thank the developers for that but it is still a chore for me to do anything in it. Buying a ticket is especially the hardest thing to do. No PayPal support, long and hidden process for the ticket purchase, defining start location even for a bundle of 4 tickets which is ridiculous. The initial time I bought a ticket it took me about 20m to setup everything. UPDATE: I'm now not able to use direct credit."

Kaufen kann man nur die offline bestehenden Tickets möglich mit gebundenen Locations - kein Check on the fly wie bei Touch &amp; Travel möglich.

They are in fact very rude people that will make anything even stalk you while you use their transport to motivate you to fight with their management for them to have higher salaries. Tickets are very expensive. This service makes bad reputation of being late even for those who are very punctual. Comming 30 minutes earlier than neccesary doesn't garantee comming on time. If you're late to work it's only your fault.
556,ernest dios,2,"July 23, 2016",0,well is good to plan journeys even better than Google maps sometimes. But often you buy a ticket and it doesn't show in your purchases. also funny bug that gives you wrong password note and you just need to insist until it let's you go through.
