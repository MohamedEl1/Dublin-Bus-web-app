0,Quark Proton,1,"May 8, 2020",25,"Quando interface was simple, easy, and straightforward. This one is too much for nothing better. It would have been better if the Quando was renamed after this one but not disable a very well done and easy to use app like Quando. Return Quando, was Much better.(also its Confusing, to have the map as a background, and to write the addresses (from- to) everytime the screen locks, everytime the screen locks, one has to make a new input to find the place instead of of doing this once)"
1,Mo Moazzen,1,"May 31, 2020",3,"It's not user friendly and even The information was wrong on 31 of May 2020 at 1 o'clock in the morning... All ubahns were closed in Wien but it said U3 coming in 5 minutes, I was on the street and app didn't give me even the night line buses informations. And all people around me looking for night line buses..."
2,Nikola Rakas,1,"June 7, 2020",1,The app keeps showing wrong arrival times. It doesn't match with the actual times that are shown on the displays in the stations. Therefore recently unreliable if you're trying to plan your route ahead.
3,Tahnee Nebauer,2,"May 4, 2020",14,"Not user friendly at all. Way too much on the screen at all times; it's very difficult to see the information you actually want/need. I appreciate the obvious effort the devs put into it, but it urgently needs streamlining. The wonderful thing about Qando was how simple and intuitive it was."
4,Benedek Tomasik,1,"June 13, 2020",0,"I try to buy a ticket with my mastercard revolut card, it asks me to confirm in the revolut app, I do it, revolut says I can go back to the merchant site, I go back to the WienMobil app and it forgets that I was buying a ticket amd nothing happens"
5,Alabina Ali,2,"May 19, 2020",2,"Quando was much more better! Interface in this app is so bad, to colorful, and the most important there are no lines of S-Bahn!!!"
6,Christoph Hinterleitner,3,"April 29, 2020",7,"Quando App was so much better. Also, in a mot of Stations and Lines it mislabels directions so you have duplicate names, like Tram 41 only having the Pötzleinsdorf label for both directions."
7,Kenjiru,1,"May 14, 2020",0,"I can no longer see my annual ticket in the app. After a lot of searching, I found a way to download the invoices from the website."
8,Christoph K,1,"June 9, 2020",0,"As long as real time data doesn't work, this will not be a suitable qando replacement"
9,Tammi Tantani,1,"April 23, 2020",0,The app doesn't work properly on Huawei...
10,Bernhard Frick,2,"February 18, 2020",29,"qando took not even a second to open and a single tap on the nearby stops to gets me the information I need. WienMobil takes about 4 to 5 seconds to load, and then requires to tap on a map and a swipe up to see the departure times I am looking for. The reload button of the favorites widget is hard to reach as a left-hander, so I preferred opening the app (left-hander option to swap placement?). I get that there is no way around retiring qando, so PLEASE make it start faster and reduce TTI!"
11,sohail ahmad,1,"February 15, 2020",25,"Worst ever app. After filling in all the information and entering the card number, it kept on processing the payment for 20minutes, yes 20 minutes and then the app crashed. It takes only a few seconds on any other app/website to process any transaction. I got a message from my bank that the amount of 8 Euros has been deducted, but still no ticket issued. There is only one word for this app 'PATHETIC' 😡"
12,Dragan Nikolic,2,"February 23, 2020",17,"Painful experience. I get notifications about closed routes in German, even though I chose English as my language. You can't select or copy those notification so there's no way of translating them. The WienMobil app never stays logged in and purchasing a ticket is one of the worst exepriences ever. You can't save your credit card, paying via PayPal takes forever and sometimes they charge the account without giving me the ticket. Very bad exeprience."
13,Tolga Cakiroglu,3,"March 8, 2020",7,"When I open the app, it does not load my favoruites. But then from the left menu, I open favoruites page, then go back map page, it loads the favoruites. Another problem is visually. There are just too much white in the design, that it is hard to focus on what I am looking at or doing."
14,Oliver Landsmann,3,"March 3, 2020",1,"It's ok, takes a little to get used to it. One painful thing is that when you add a stop to your favorites and the bus has no live department times it always shows up as having no times at all. When you look at the stop it shows the scheduled times."
15,Marsid Nuho,1,"June 10, 2020",0,AWFUL! Route calculation says there is Ubahn running all night and you arrive to the station and they're closing down! AWFUL! NOT TRUSTWORTHY!
16,Peter Angelov,1,"June 12, 2020",1,I'm so sorry to say this but this app has one of the worst user experience I ever seen. I hope it will improve over time.
17,Anna T.,2,"February 21, 2020",6,Qando had a sharing feature one could use to send their friend their route or suggest a journey which I can't find here. It was very convenient for locals and visitors alike. Please add this feature.
18,nicole zayac,1,"February 18, 2020",21,"Quando is 10000x easier &amp; better. User interface is too crowded looking. When all you need is the monitor &amp; route info, all of the other stuff is so unnecessary to have on the screen."
19,dK dU,1,"March 7, 2020",3,Functionality is bad: Setting a different walking speed has no impact on travel time. Own car is slower than taxi or car sharing (???). Quando was and is better (sadly). I tested it for 2 minutes.
20,Viliam Cigan,3,"March 14, 2020",0,It takes circa 90 sec ( loading times) to buy a ticket. Some other apps make it in 5 seconds. Why is the difference so big?
21,Alex Popescu,2,"February 13, 2020",2,"Nice app, interaction, info etc. However, you cannot edit personal info! As typos may happen, editing them should not be a problem..."
22,Sam Edge,1,"March 14, 2020",4,"The idea is good, but please fix the following bugs: 1) i get always logged out of my account 2) i cannot see my yearly ticket because of some technical issue 3) the information on the map regarding Carsharing is not valid"
23,F. Christoph,1,"February 24, 2020",8,"give us an option to disable the map and just open favorites directly without having to click on it and scroll up, was perfect in qando... terribly bloated!"
24,Michael Lux,1,"March 4, 2020",5,"To manage your ticket purchase, its great. Compared to quando, trip management, this app is useless"
25,Lizette Navarro,1,"March 7, 2020",0,"I cant see Sbahn anymore neither to a marked them as favourite. Definitely staying w Qando as long as possible! The app keep asking for permission to see my contacts info, why is this needed?!"
26,Andrii Velychko,4,"February 19, 2020",0,"Could you please add ""Quick map"", just like in Qando? I'm using it quite often."
27,sanja gajic,1,"March 30, 2020",2,Bring back qando!! We dont like this.. UI is awful..
28,Sarmad Khan,1,"March 31, 2020",2,Qando Wien much better this app is very poorly not easy to use
29,Ion Miscisin,2,"May 26, 2020",0,why can't one sort by time in monitor?!
30,N. Koller,1,"May 11, 2020",1,"So much less user friendly than Quando. I don't think it is necessary to have the map of where you are as the first thing you see. Instead of having to swipe up to see the stops, this should be the initial view. And, as far as I can see, there is no option to have it open on your favourites."
31,Cristian Iorga,5,"March 12, 2020",1,Gute App. Google Apps + Quando in einem.
32,Florian Geiger,2,"December 29, 2019",3,Very unstable and buying a ticket takes too long with many steps the sometimes break at the last step of payment. Really great idea (in theory) but right now it cannot even show me any route with public transport (temporary problem?). Also for me only storing one payment method is also not enough when using it for private and business reasons. Unfortunately for buying tickets mobile this is the only way.
33,Iryna Svedovetska,1,"April 15, 2020",1,"Cant even download. The procedure is in progress for about 2 hours. The internet connection is ok. It is not the reason. I do have enough, this is also not the reason. May I use the older version? This is horrible if I even can't manage installing"
34,Jakub Mandula,1,"January 3, 2020",16,"User experience is terrible for the tickets. It does not let you autofill you credit card details so you are forced to always type them or copy them manually. And now I bought a day ticket, it took money from my bank but the app crashed while it was loading and now the ticket is not showing up. No confirmation email but the money is gone. Totally useless. If you need to buy a ticket in a pinch it will let you hanging. Now I am not sure if I can get on the train or not and miss my appointment..."
35,Maddy Barnes,1,"March 9, 2020",2,This app is awful. Why are you retiring a perfectly functional app for a worse one?
36,Okoh Emmanuel,1,"April 16, 2020",1,Quando was better you can even identifie how many stop the train drive 🤬🤬
37,Iva Ivaiva,1,"March 7, 2020",1,"I'm finding it really stupid to replace something that work, with something not even better"
38,Boris Rewald,3,"January 11, 2020",3,"Compared with quando, I have noticed that the reported arrival time of the 10A is given wrong fro several stations and in the widget. Thus, the app does nt seem to be as reliable as quando yet, although the concept of integration div. Mobility types is much better"
39,Arnold Lovas,1,"January 16, 2020",4,"Many times my yearly ticket disappeared (I see something from 2016), they almost punished me because of that. I have tickets since 2016, the refresh button does nothing, logoff login did not help."
40,Colette Tan,2,"October 15, 2019",2,"EDIT: Although I had great difficulties with the app the first day and a half, the issue has been resolved and I have added one more star. __ I bought a 72 hour ticket with airport transport from your mobile app shop. However, my app has been hanging and unable to load anything since yesterday night. It has been 12 hours and I am unable to view my tickets, which I need by Tuesday noon. I have re-installed my app countless times to no avail. I even restarted my phone. Extremely disappointed."
41,Robert Jacobi,3,"September 1, 2019",4,"Unfortunately, the ticket syncing is unreliable and I constantly lose the information for my yearly ticket. Also the syncing fires multiple times a day and needs too much time on my Huawei. Other than that, the design is really nice and modern, although it takes some time to get used to this app and know how to handle the information properly."
42,ivan c,2,"November 7, 2018",2,"Cannot see my yearly ticket in the app although I got the ticket few weeks ago. I followed the instructions on the internet, tried to log out / log in, reinstall..but still no card. I called them and got an answer just to follow the instructions, although I tried to explain I did. Sent them an email with a detailed description of an error with a screenshot few weeks ago but still no answer. Edit: made a contact as suggested in reply and followed instructions and no problems more (and gave a little bit better review). But you should improve UX on that. Thank you for answer"
43,Georgios Halkias,3,"September 11, 2019",2,"It is very problematic with the tickets. I bought my new Jahreskarte a week ago and still nothing appears on the app, plus all previous payments (i.e. history) have disappeared. To make things worse, Wiener Linien hasn't even sent me the physical card... I have sent them 3 emails and no reply yet. [EDIT] After ~ 2 weeks it finally works. Still, not satisfied with responsiveness and communication."
44,Jasenko Ramljak,2,"February 4, 2020",0,Idea is good but the app keeps logging me out and once i log in the tickets button stops working and I can only reach my ticket via the tickets menu. Once that's fixed I'll update my review.
45,Bassileios,1,"September 25, 2019",7,"I don't understand what are trying to accomplish with this app. Most of the features that the app provide are not needed since there better apps that provide navigation and transit times. The UI is not user friendly, it's just over engineered. From my usage I only needed the app to buy tickets (which is the most important feature) but unfortunately it doesn't work most of times even they charged me the ticket price twice when I tried to buy it using Master Card."
46,Lev Lafayette,1,"November 9, 2019",9,"This app lacks basic sanity checks and unit testing. When a 72 hour pass is purchased with return airport tickets, it automatically assumes that the airport tickets are for the day or purchase, rather than the day of the pass. This is an insane assumption, and worse still it cannot be changed. Seriously, this is the worst app I have ever had to use. Shame on you Vienna for even releasing this broken application to the public. EDIT: My partner has installed this app as well. It took her money, but the app keeps crashing, and when it finally opens it won't display the tickets. THIS IS A TERRIBLE APP THAT SHOULD NOT BE RELEASED TO THE PUBLIC. IT SIMPLY DOES NOT WORK. NB: Ignore the comment from the shill below. They WILL NOT refund you. This software is broken."
47,Anna F.,4,"February 12, 2020",2,"Works well. Once I paid but it didn't give me my ticket. Emailed support and for the ticket. Overall it's well made, but the payments systems isn't well integrated with the rest."
48,Foo Bar,2,"January 8, 2019",1,"Bad UX, not enough alternative routes, for my main connection every route is with tram 2, bad luck if the ring is blocked, in this case there is only a small yellow ! showing you that every route shown is unusable. If your annual ticket subscription is renewed it does funny things in the ticket view. The new card is shown as not downloaded, then it ""downloads"" and just disappears, after the old ticket expired it showed ""no tickets"" for some time until it finally found the new ticket."
49,Sandra Mayer,1,"June 2, 2019",5,"The UI is pretty bad, especially when coming from the qando app. You click on tickets there and have to select tickets again in the wienMobil app. Payment data is not remembered, has to be re-entered over and over again. Payment did not work. My payment app saud, it was successful, but the WienMobil App said an error occured and did not show a ticket! I had to buy a paper-ticket in addition! I'd uninstall immediately, but will wait to be able to prove I didn't get a ticket despite payment."
50,Thomas Andessner,4,"October 7, 2019",7,App works fast and quite good. I use it now for over 2 Years. The problem is that when I open another app after sometimes my chosen rout is deleted and I have to insert the datails again. Another thing is that the application doesn't show the platform (for example local trains from ÖBB) the train is leaving. You can not buy tickets for a whole trip for example a trip from Vienna to a surrounding village.
51,Richard Varga,2,"November 20, 2019",2,"Dear dev team, Panel on the top of screen ""Downloading resources"" or ""Ticket synchronizatiin"" appears very often and blocks the place where one can tap to look up destination for some 20 seconds, which gets quite annoying. Especially when user has Jahreskarte, what is the app synchronizing so often for such a long time (on 4G internet)?!?! Please fix this bug ASAP. Thanks."
52,Bogdan Kharchykov,1,"September 12, 2019",4,"How is it possible that one of the best public transportation networks in the world has one of the worst ticketing app? Every 2-3 months I give this app a chance, and it ends the same way: if for any reason you move away from the app, for example to read the TAN-SMS, your money get booked from the card, no ticket gets issued and you have to start your journey with support. Worst experience ever."
53,Csaba Salat,1,"September 18, 2019",2,"never works when it's needed, always bring your card with you. update: yes, today it didn't work at all and the error message was clear, so it's okay, happens.. The problem is the following: when the inspector asks me to show my ticket, I can't use this, because it takes ages to load."
54,Razvan Pencu,3,"October 16, 2019",1,"Buggy. Worked fine when buying the tickets, which from the reviews seems to be an issue in itself, but stuck when opening next time. I assume, hopefully, that printed tickets are valid, I will have to check when using them. Update: started to work after couple of days, even the tickets buying was ok. Needs ""tinkering""."
55,Vdhdhd Benend,1,"December 27, 2019",19,"as a foreigner for buying a 2,40Eur ticket, register all your personal details, make an account, get a confirmation email, open browser, confirm with password, go into app, try to buy again, fill in your personal address, finally come to the Visa card entry screen...honestly..worst ticket buying experience ever. app deleted"
56,Sergey Tolokunsky,1,"August 19, 2019",1,"I purchased a 48 hour ticket. The app offered me to buy the to and return ticket for the airport. Of course I expected that the return ticket will be valid within 48 hours, but it was not. It was valid only for the purchase day. So I spent money for nothing, and no return/change option is available in the app. Poor experience."
57,Cat C.,1,"November 17, 2019",3,"Wiener Linien are great this app is a nightmare! It can't even tell me how long it takes from one place to another by public transport. Every other option (bike, walk, etc.) works but the public transport truly is sh**! Sorry I really love Wiener Linien but they should be able to do better than this stupid app. All I get is an error message for the public transport option on a constant basis. I mean seriously WTH?!?!?"
58,Marvin K,1,"September 3, 2019",1,"No option to add an ticket you already bought, very poor design choice! I bought a Semesterkarte online, but not with the app, once logged into the app, i have no active tickets. trying to add it results in an error called: Fehler innerhalb der Geschäftsvereinbarung. System is way to confusing for people."
59,Niina Hagman,2,"January 28, 2020",3,"Horribly slow server response times, and poor user experience, takes forever before you can actually purchase a ticket.."
60,Darren Beattie,3,"August 18, 2019",1,"Easy way to purchase public transportation tickets. Unfortunately not very GDPR compliant, there is no way (from within the app) to remove my data (or payment method) once I've left Vienna. GDPR means I should be able to easily delete this information from your database. The app is somewhat slow and a little buggy on top of that."
61,Patrick,1,"August 28, 2019",3,"buying tickets is impossible without raging out.i.e. buying a singel trip ticket. you set everything up and press purchase. u wait 20 seconds. it responds with ""due to server error.."" you press again.""order cancelled"".""time out"".then you finally get to the payment information. u fill in and press purchase. sometimes u get an immediate response.""error"" along with a payment confirmation email(paypal). u hit again till u get an email of confirmation of wienerlinien. ticket shop sucks big time."
62,Alessandro Mulloni,3,"September 11, 2019",1,"Nice integrated app for all services in Vienna. Unfortunately my yearly ticket does not show up in the app most of the times. The old Wiener Linien app has the same problem (maybe a server issue?). I can see all my other older purchases, just the yearly pass is missing."
63,Matthias Huber,1,"January 30, 2019",11,"Constantly downloading data in the background, but when you actually open it to show your ticket to an inspector, it takes 5 minutes to load a single ticket. It's hard to believe how much this organization is struggling to release an app that actually fulfills the must basic of purposes."
64,Milan Yovchev,1,"September 3, 2019",0,"Doesn't work and isn't reliable at all. At this stage doesn't deserve to be beta app, and this is in production. Existing yearly card is not displayed, app make sync on every five minute and doesn't retrieve correct information. Beside that ordering of new card doesn't work already couple days."
65,Zoltán Magyarics,1,"August 14, 2019",8,"Still a total disaster. Most importantly: very slow. Crashes frequently as well. Last time it crashed in the last stage of a ticket purchase - ticket already paid, but does not show up in the application. Now what? Am I a ""Schwarzfahrer"" after actually paying the ticket...?"
66,Iulia Buzatoiu,1,"November 15, 2019",2,Twice it happened that I was charged for a ticket and it wouldn't be displayed in the app/gave me an error. The app keeps crushing but still charges you. Worth it if you only use it rarely. But overall you will just lose money. So use with caution.
67,Jafar SS,5,"December 25, 2019",6,Nearby departures are displayed fast and nicely! I prefer this slick app over the slow and overweight Google map. Perfect for people like me who walk and take public transport daily. Good job!
68,Andy Tomlinson,3,"November 29, 2019",2,"Rated this one 🌟 then remove the app, then reload the app, was as before, then after closing the app and restarting it the app came to life, it's a shame that such a great transport system has such a low app rating 🙄 unfortunately after reinstall it was flagged up for being power intensive so I removed it again 😔"
69,Chris Schwarz,1,"August 24, 2019",2,"Buggy. Can't switch off expensive options like CAT or VAL. Need to stop my navigation for settings menu to be accessable. Sells tickets, but doesn't offer the right ticket for my trip. No option to activate the ""Jahreskarte"" and see what's included."
70,Baran Sari,1,"September 16, 2019",3,"Worst ticketing app ever!!! Over 2 months cannot buy tickets, withdrawals of money but no ticket!! Instead of fixing the issue they put a warning message about the issue with ticket purchases. Such an unprofessional way if working."
71,Steve Foister,1,"October 4, 2019",2,"Didn't work. It will not find my work address, nor home: though Qando knows them. Inputting destinations is difficult, with the app resizing. You cannot even just select from the map. Uninstalling and going back to Qando and the old Wiener Linien App."
72,Wolfgang Magerl,1,"March 6, 2019",2,Horrible user experience. Starts automatically on system start and displays emty notifications. Buying tickets takes up to 5 minutes. Sometimes doesn't work at all (server error). Support doesn't respond.
73,Jonathan Leo,2,"March 4, 2020",2,Useful but it's a battery hogger. GPS won't turn off after exiting app. Had to uninstall because of that reason
74,A Google user,2,"October 19, 2018",1,"Good app. Adding an downloadable Offline map along with navigation, transports connectivity to get from the source to destination, offline Citybike stations would make the app more likeable and more usable."
75,A M,1,"November 9, 2019",6,"Too many steps to buy a ticket. Once payment went through, the app stuck on a loading screen, so I could not use my ticket at all! Terrible experience."
76,nichirvan Ali,2,"June 3, 2020",0,Quando is better. Why dont you support both Apps
77,Herbert Zaczyk,2,"August 19, 2019",0,"good looking UI, but always loading in the background or even downloadjng something. I have a yearly ticket, this should not load for several minutes, when it is valid for such a lomg period"
78,A Google user,4,"January 8, 2019",10,"The interface is quite nice, and having the various transport options together in one app is fantastic..... I'm happy to add another star from a previous review now that the map freeze is fixed."
79,Dragan Milovanović,1,"April 1, 2019",1,"Battery drain more then 30% overnight (test for two months), well not only over nights, app is constantly downloading something in background. Uninstalled applicatiin, everything is backed in normal."
80,A Google user,1,"January 5, 2019",0,"Be careful, when taking CAT return ticket: you need to fill in the return date separately. If you miss that entry, all you have is a return ticket on your day of arrival."
81,Erica Hoehn,1,"October 19, 2019",1,"Does not even rate one star. The app managed to stay open long enough for me to buy a ticket, but then kept crashing so I could not access the ticket 😡"
82,scottishdoc,5,"August 13, 2019",0,"Seems to be ok, be careful when ordering tickets that you get the right dates, had the wrong date on one of the tickets, although support managed to sort it out thanks."
83,Yevhenii Vasiutenko,1,"September 12, 2019",1,"takes money, but not gives a ticket. support via email not answering during week. On info point in the metro (U-Bahn) station also can't help to resolution this issue. So sad. I hope my bank will return money. Worst application"
84,Simon Osim,1,"December 28, 2019",5,"Worst ticket process ever!! Takes ages, is confusing."
85,lori f,1,"July 3, 2019",3,"Unfortunately I mistyped some personal information. Now I'm told it's ""Not modifiable"". This is very sad, because this way validation with my university fails :( Definitely this bug should be fixed!"
86,Любомир Вівчарик,1,"August 20, 2019",1,"I going to visit Vienna soon and decide, that it is good for me buy week ticket in this app. I made a payment, but no ticket appear in my profile. Support still doesn't answer to me second day. I don't know what I should to do. Waiting for refund and try again, waiting for the ticket or what. My trip is coming soon and I should solve this to know what to do. It's looks like support just ignore me."
87,Kristina Konjic,3,"October 1, 2018",2,Ever since the last update I can't seem to zoom into the map when I'm looking for a route.... Hope this will change back soon...
88,David Chang,1,"June 8, 2019",2,"online ticket purchase didnt work. my credit card has been charged, but there is no transaction history, hence no ticket"
89,Gintautas Stankevicius,1,"October 27, 2019",1,It crashes Evey time I trying to open it (androidone). I can't see already bought tickets. The old Wiener linen app helps me. It works fine.
90,Damo Clark,1,"November 4, 2019",4,DO NOT USE THIS APP I have just tried to buy a 48 hour ticket twice. Neither time worked. I have now paid for two of these tickets and have nothing to show for it.
91,Ivan Lazic,5,"December 7, 2018",6,"Excellent app with great transport option you want to use in Vienna and with a great guidance. Buying tickets for tram or bus has never been easier. Guys, great job!!! Well done👍"
92,Róża Turowska,1,"October 26, 2018",2,"If you want to make an app for a public transport, first, check how to do it. Stockholm or Helsinki did a great job. Wien Mobile has super bad and painful UX."
93,Nop9 Nine9,1,"September 12, 2019",1,"Very bad apps. Buy ticket on the app, got charged money but app failed to generate the ticket. Bad experiences on the app and office ticket of Wien liner at Wien Main station."
94,Tech Support,4,"October 1, 2019",0,"Easy to install and use, you can buy tickets in seconds. Shows POI and stops for public transport, bycicles. Shows next bus, train, etc. Useful"
95,A Google user,3,"November 20, 2018",0,"Great app, if it wouldn't log me out everytime it closes, even though i have the ""stay logged in"" option checked. Very annoying."
96,Karol Lukács,1,"April 15, 2019",2,"Always downloading background data, terrible way calculating, forced to use app because on website you can not buy single ride ticket."
97,Jakub Lanc,2,"April 29, 2019",3,"Requires way too much personal data, unspecified errors in processing payments, unintuitive UI."
98,Peter Kurz,5,"December 14, 2019",1,"Please change the app icon because it looks really ugly on Samsung phones. Note: on Samsung phones, icons are ""squircle"" shaped. Update: problem has been solved, thank you!"
99,Irfan,2,"November 26, 2018",0,"It's such a pity, that the map of a city like Vienna issued officially by the Very City Council but still lacks English language, I wasn't expecting such a thing from the officials of a city which has been the number 1 city for so many years"
100,Milan L.,1,"December 6, 2019",0,The confirmation code for the registration never arrived. Especially bad if you are in a hurry to buy a ticket...

144,M. Vaubs,3,"June 3, 2020",1,"Danke für den fix. Volle Punkte dann, wenn ich in der Wochenend Nacht fehlerfrei nach Hause navigiert werde. Gerade zur U-Bahn gerannt nur um ""Betriebsschluss"" auf der Anzeige zu lesen. Könnt ihr nichtmal die aktuellen Fahrplan Daten anzeigen? WTF. War Fr um 1:15h an der U6 Thalia-Straße.

Sinnlose, nutzlose App. Wo ist Quando?"

Um die Abfahrtszeiten zu sehen, muss ich jedes Mal scrollen - dafür nimmt die Karte, die ich meistens nicht brauche oder gerne bei Bedarf einblende, den größten Teil des Displays ein. Auch die Buttons für E-Scooter und Taxi brauche ich nicht. Fazit: Die App kann viel, das funktioniert auch, aber sie sollte anpassbarer sein."

Die Ansicht für die Favoriten ist unbequem und auch nicht so ausgebaut wie bei Qando. Man kann auch nicht ganz spontan einen Favoriten hinzufügen. Generell gibt es so viel weniger Möglichkeiten, in den Einstellungen Bequemlichkeiten zu definieren - zB wo der Startbildschirm ist. Unbrauchbar!"

165,Štěpán Hrobař,2,"February 20, 2020",1,"Die App meldet den User (mich) immer nach einem Tag ab. Dadurch geht eine wichtige Funktion verloren, und zwar die Jahreskarte am Handy. Denn es ist schneller, meine Geldbörse zu finden und die Plastikkarte rausnehmen, als immer wieder das Kennwort eintippen zu müssen. Und auch wenn man eingeloggt bleibt, dauert es noch, bis die Jahreskarte oben in der Ecke sichtbar ist, und auch wenn sie schon sichtbar ist, kann man die Taste noch einen Moment nicht anklicken. Also verbesserungsbedürftig!"
166,Bianca Karigl,1,"March 6, 2020",1,"Die neue App macht mich fertig. Es ist unübersichtlich.

Qando startet in 1 Sekunde und zeigt mir sofort meine nähesten Favoriten mit Echtzeitinfo an. Hier dauert das Kir neuerlichen Einloggen und Wartezeiten 3O Sekunden, das ist unbenutzbar.

Nachtrag am 29 nov 2017  Aufgrund der Bewertungen ist offensichtlich, dass die App Schott ist. Das feedback der Wr.

281,Marina Glaser,2,"June 17, 2017",10,"This is meant to be better than Google maps integration, so you should at least add basic Gmaps functionality and then some. Why can't we search for contacts, filter routes to only use the subway (when I set the filter, the app still only shows me the bus route), buy parking tickets, etc... The people of Vienna are loosing out on Gmaps integration, so do as promised and deliver something way better."
282,A Google user,5,"June 25, 2017",2,I am positively surprised by this app. Maps integration with bus stops locations is a real improvement! Very clean and clear interface with detailed walking distance instructions - amazing!! One suggestion: How about adding a sorting filter by the number of changes (min changes on top). This would eliminate the confusion of well-known simple routes being presented in too complicated way.
283,Paul Kra,1,"June 17, 2017",14,"This app is a joke and even releasing it in this state is already highly offensive towards your customers.
