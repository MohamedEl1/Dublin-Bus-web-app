0,Bruno Carvalho da Costa,3,"May 6, 2020",2,"The app is OK, I use it everyday. The only problem is that the support team does not support you at all. My app is displaying a blank ticket for months now and never goes away. I tried clearing the cache and reinstalling the app but nothing works. I sent the support team three emails already and received no answer."
1,Todor Georgiev,4,"May 15, 2020",2,"It says that checking my credit card will cost 1 Euro, which will be immediately returned. Instead, App took 2 (two) times 1 Euro each, and didn't returned my money immediately after paying the ticket, but a week later."
2,Antoine Thiry,1,"January 15, 2020",1,"I bought a 10 stripes ticket along with redeeming 2 stripes for my journey, I got the stripe ticket with 8 credits left but my 2 stripes ticket is not in there. I will not buy another one but crossing my fingers to not get ticket control. Used to work fine before, since update it just downgraded in quality by a lot. Also, I didn't get any email confirmation for my purchase as it was before..."
3,John Doe,2,"January 15, 2020",0,Since the 2nd update after change of fare structure the departure times shown under the journey and departure section differ. Also current location does not update although location permission is given. Gets stuck at the first location the app was opened at. Only updates after opening (for example) GPS Status app in parallel.
4,Danijel Kurinčič,1,"February 29, 2020",4,Ever since the last update the app randomly can't get location or timeouts on ticket purchase. Such a shame and ridiculous as I now never know if I need to buy the tickets on the machines. Is it so hard to make this work when every stupid app can do it
5,Zoltán Gyarmati,1,"January 16, 2020",0,"Instead of integrating a map provider, this app relies on the Google Maps services, and in turn it requires the user to have a Google account registered on her phone. Why one needs a Google account to plan a trip with MVG?"
6,Manfred,5,"January 12, 2020",0,"The app has been updated. now the connections make more sense, the delays are shown directly and all the stops in between are shown."
7,Younes Orli-Idrissi,3,"January 14, 2020",0,"I like how easy it is to use. However, one big thing that would make the usage better; make information more English friendly"
8,Michael Schmidt,4,"March 7, 2020",0,Easy to use and works reliably. @devs Some visual feedback for the Add to Cart button press in My tickets would be nice or sth more visible should I have missed it :)
9,00Visor,3,"December 23, 2019",0,"App works for me now, but not happy that the new update wiped my entire ticket history :/."
10,thomas preston,1,"December 29, 2019",4,"better, but still typically German overcomplicated and outrageously expensive. Other cities have one price for all trips long or short, some are even free and actually save money by not paying all the controllers and administrators. Mvg has a long way to go to enter the modern world. It should be a public service, not just another way to squeeze money out of the poor people. Those who can afford their prices drive their cars anyway and do not use the Mvg."
11,oscar bragado zapatero,1,"December 21, 2019",4,"Since latest update and merge with M login, app simply doesn't work. Redeem tickets times out, tickets even fail to be purchased in the app but then are invoiced in my payment method! I cant rely on it anymore when jumping into a train and need to manually purchase my tickets now in a vending machine. Please fix it, this used to be a great app"
12,M Harnischfeger,1,"December 20, 2019",2,"First App I ever rated in six years of google play usage. The app has never been functional, but as it simply stopped working (functional errors everywhere) with the new updates it is simply not usable anymore. Back to paper tickets means missing my subway home. Thank you for MVG for ruining this one as well."
13,Bjoern K.,1,"December 19, 2019",2,App is broken. Ticket purchase got stuck several times and I received time out error messages. then I bought the Ticket offline. now I see in the Ticket history that I seem to have bought 3 Tickets which never have been shown as a successful purchase. please advice how I get refunded for these 3 Tickets. thanks.
14,soubarna banik,1,"April 15, 2019",2,"1. Basic information such as intermediate stops are missing. 2. Though there exists routes involving trams and ubahn, the app simply does not show it (and trams are checked in my settings). It has happened multiple times, on multiple routes. 3. In case of a change at a stop, it doesn't indicate if the bus stops are at different locations. That it involves walking from one bus stop to another, it should notify that. The proposed route does not remain viable if one involves the time for walking."
15,Catarina Martins Freire,2,"December 20, 2019",2,Since the update the app has errors frequently. You want to buy a ticket and end up missing your train because the app isn't working.
16,Ahmed Adel,3,"December 15, 2018",1,"I like that when there is any problem in transportation it reports it but I don't like that I have to check manually ,no notification appears also it doesn't suggest another transportation means if there is blocking on the main line. Also I don't know why I can't buy monthly ticket through the app but I can buy other types of tickets."
17,A Google user,3,"September 18, 2018",6,"As a foreigner who just moved to Munich, I have found this app to be good and useful overall. Just got confused with the way it handles the multiple-journey tickets (""Streifenkart"") so in my first purchase I have lost eight stripes at once, and now I buy only single tickets, which are simpler and safer. The tickets activation and expiration deadline should be much better and clearly explained than they are in the app. Also, the ticket ""image"" generated and displayed in German does not help."
18,Elena Deneva,1,"December 10, 2019",1,"It used to work quite well, but recently I was charged without being able to see the ticket so I had to buy another one. Once I was charged twice : I was having problem with the network and when I reconnect to the network the payment went twice. I used also the app to buy a ticket for a friend and a week later after when I wanted to buy a ticket for myself, the ticket was a copy of the one I bought for my friend. I couldn't find a way to request a refund...."
19,aqeel arshad,1,"December 3, 2019",9,"Non functional App with internal Error everywhere. I wasted half hour trying to buy an extension ticket. It was all working fine until yesterday, when i updated the app. New update made me create an other ID with SWM( Stadtwerk München) and afterwards it took more then 15 mins just to add SEPA details. Then, it just kept looping trying to buy the ticket eventually I downloaded ""MVV-App"" and bought the ticket."
20,Athul Prabhu,1,"December 4, 2019",2,Terrible experience trying to purchase a ticket. The app could not detect my location. I tried entering it manually and it still would not recognise. After several attempts i picked a random near by location and proceeded to purchase where the transaction either errored out or was taking forever to complete where at some point I had to give up. Terrible experience especially when on your way to the airport and time bound
21,Y L,1,"November 5, 2019",5,Actually a good App but hard to use in Munich with terrible network infrastructure. Had to pay 60+ euro and gained bad record once I used to rely on it. Well by the time I purchased the ticket the internet was super bad and only noticed that it did not work after some time (stayed in the shopping cart). Tried to pay again and worked but then got controlled. Paid the ticket price and still need to pay the full fine. Never trust the internet in Germany! It's a big joke.
22,Jan S,1,"January 6, 2019",6,Apart from cashless paying no benefit of having this app. Really old-school and way too complex too buy a ticket. There should be a paypal payment available. It's a beginning but so far the app design is really not suited for what it's supposed to do: Quickly allowing to buy an online ticket.
23,satya patnaik,4,"November 15, 2019",0,"The app doesn't worked many times though having proper network.. Ticket download also didn't happened.. The app has lot much information about the trains and timings.. User interface needs to be improved. Though selecting english as language, the messages appears in German. Increased my rating to 4 based on the information the app contains."
24,Beany Hynes,1,"December 13, 2019",6,"The worst app by far and the main reason is because the information is not accurate or in real-time. Munich underground is by far the worst I have ever experienced.Delays on a daily basis. The U1 and the U3 are terrible with lots of trains being cancelled or especially the U7 not running, which, when using the app, you are never informed about. So many times i have turned up at the station after checking train times to discover delays or problems or to find out the U7 is cancelled for the day."
25,Vassilis Kazazakis,1,"December 4, 2019",4,"Terrible, the new version with the MLogin is extremely buggy. Buying new tickets fails with error messages all the time. You have to repeat the process again and again until hopefully 20minutes later (literally), the request goes through! Terrible"
26,Atacan Çonduroğlu,1,"May 2, 2019",6,To buy a ticket you need to enter your master card information. once you do this app charges you withiu any notice 1EUR. Unless I see this fund back in my account couple days will report the app to google store to be taken down. So right now not sure if it is programming without adult supervision or just plain scam.
27,Indrajit Ghosh,1,"November 7, 2019",1,"The latest version release has issues. Buying ticket which worked seamlessly earlier does not work. It shows the purchase is complete, downloading ticket and then nothing. Options like connection Ticket (Anschluss) not available. Please check."
28,Richard Gregory,1,"December 4, 2019",2,"Used to be great, unusable since the last update. No longer possible to buy tickets, even if you already have streifenkarte credit. Unfortunately not possible to give zero stars."
29,Bnjmo Med,1,"October 19, 2018",1,This works only 10% of the time I wanna (need to) use it. It's either the bike is not where it is located on the map or the bike won't return. Just a nightmare this service!
30,Lina Vosyle,1,"February 1, 2019",2,GPS location doesn't work. it used to work and now doesn't find me anymore. when trains are cancelled doesn't give another option to reach the destination.
31,Vamsi G,1,"December 4, 2019",3,"Cannot buy tickets, the app keeps showing loading loading and nothing gets loaded for a very long time. Has happened that ticket was bought but never appeared in my app.. Please rectify this issue."
32,Filippo Mazza,1,"April 3, 2019",3,"Ok, but possibly dangerous for fines. Basically they can fine you if you don't buy the tickets 'sufficiently in advance'. A network delay while buying it can give you a ticket one minute later and then they fine you. You should solve this problem with MVG personnel."
33,Edward Hades,1,"July 19, 2019",3,"Couldn't buy a ticket because of ""System maintenance"", that I wasn't alerted about. Had to ride without a ticket at risk of prosecution. Avoid."
34,Mikayel Sahakyan,1,"December 4, 2019",2,After updating to new version app stops functioning properly. When trying to buy a ticket you need to wait around 4 - 5 minutes after which you get Error.
35,Istrati Serghei,1,"December 2, 2019",3,I would give Zero stars. The App doesn't work. Tickets can't be purchased. It creates only stress. Old login MVG was better. Shade. Der umstieg zum M Login funktioniert nicht. Shade
36,Felix Buggenthin,1,"December 4, 2019",2,"Broken since the update (cannot specify location, auto detection doesn't work) , also the new way of buying tickets is more complicated"
37,Anton Gorev,1,"December 12, 2019",2,Login simply doesn't work. I've updated the app with a valid ticket in it. And in a new version login Gateaway Timeout error occurres!
38,Tai Steyn,1,"December 18, 2019",1,Completely broken. Do not rely on this app to buy your tickets.
39,Matthias Eckhardt,3,"December 2, 2019",1,A lot of issues lately Cant buy tickets sometimes because of ResponseException 503 or StreamResetException: stream was reset INTERNAL_ERROR Used to work perfectly before but nowadays its not reliable anymore
40,shrek wazowski,2,"August 26, 2019",1,"A lot of bugs, as soon as there is a disturbance the suggested routes are overly complicated and most of the time routes from locals are a lot faster and easier"
41,Davor Milohnic,2,"October 19, 2019",0,"Actually it's a great app, but why there is no info about cancelled trains! Already second time no info about cancelled RE train from FS to HBF!!!"
42,Alexey Stukalov,1,"November 29, 2019",2,"Error 500, Error 503. And now I don't see the ticket I bought. Why have you broken the app?"
43,ernest dios,3,"December 2, 2019",8,"The app is good but sometimes returns and error when buying the tickets, mostly on pick hours. So don't rely on it."
44,Jonas Reimers,1,"December 20, 2019",1,Only server errors and http errors - please fix your backends asap.
45,Murat Mutlu Ozturk,1,"November 30, 2019",2,I wish I could give 0 starts It is like an agony to buy a ticket with this app. Please revert to the old certain.
46,Malvin Bernard,5,"November 6, 2018",7,"Great app, especially with the added ""bring me home"" functionality. Not a super fancy UI but it's fast, no ads, easy to understand."

Example: ""Lauensteinstrasse 9, 81549 München"" will not be found. The app will not be able to suggest the nearest stop (U-bahn/S-bahn/tram etc). The Deutsche Bahn app can do that. 4) Tried again in Jan 2017: Search always returns no results. Sometimes search takes very long. Update 09.2017: No improvements yet. Dev team is sleeping."

Und wenn's dann doch mal klappt bekommt man den dreisten Hinweis in rot man soll das Ticket vor dem Einsteigen kaufen !? Ja würde ich gerne wenn's denn ginge ... Dann kommt noch dazu, dass trotz Fehlern häufig später dennoch abgebucht wird was dann zu doppelt und dreifach Abbuchungen führt."

Your destination is easy to find, the app automatically suggests the correct tickets (usually hard to find out at the machine), you can also punch in addresses. There's even a map overview included to find your way from a stop to the actual place. You can even buy stripe tickets and monthly passes. Definitely worth using!"

es wenn man versucht Tickets für mehr als eine Person zu kaufen. Das 
Geburtsdatum aus dem Profil wird nicht übernommen und muss vor dem Kauf 
manuell mit dem Android Date Picker eingegeben werden. Warum es überhaupt 
benötigt wird ist auch nicht klar... Liebe MVG, schneidet Euch mal besser

Funktion unter Meine Ringe nämlich den Unterschied zwischen Isarcard und 
Isarcard 9 Uhr. z.B ich besitze eine Isarcard 9 Uhr für den gesamten Netz 
und fahre normalerweise nicht zwischen 6-9 Uhr. Die übliche Fahrtzeit ist 
50 Minuten und über 3.(Start) bis 10. (End) Ringe gestreckt. Variante 1. An 
einem besonderen Tag möchte ich um 8:30 losfahren und das Isarcard ist noch 
nicht gültig aber wird ab 9 Uhr gültig sein. Nach meinem Fahrplan befinde 
ich mich im 6. Ring um 9 Uhr. Wenn ich ein Ticket vor der Fahrt kaufen 
möchte, bietet die App mir das Ticket für die gesamte Strecke und nicht die 
tatsächliche Teilstrecke, wo ich zusätzliches Ticket benötige. Variante 2. 
Auch wenn ich schon um 7 Uhr fahren möchte und meine Ringe in der App von 
1. bis 16. eingestellt habe, die App sagt, “keine zusätzliche Ticket 
benötigt“, obwohl mein Isarcard noch nicht gültig ist. Da muss ich die 
Ringe jedes mal zurücksetzen um das richtige Ticket zu suchen. Also bitte 
denk dran!!"
