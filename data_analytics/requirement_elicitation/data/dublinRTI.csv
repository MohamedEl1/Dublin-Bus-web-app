0,Jack Barrett,5,"October 31, 2018",6,"VERY good app. But there are 3 things. If you can't connect to their API it's gonna say no info available. Even when it works soon after the refresh button in app just does nothing. Only when I reopen it works. The other thing is ""expected delays"" should be shown in app. Also option to change between ""minutes left"" and exact time will be nice."
1,BluInstinct,4,"December 5, 2018",2,"Very good app, needs to start showing RTI for the bus routes GoAhead have taken over though, I mainly use the 17a and now I can't check real time for it. The TFI app is useless so depending on this one"
2,Paulo Lush Imports,2,"February 13, 2019",6,"if it worked would be really handy, but it just doesnt, no matter if im with 4G or right beside a wifi router. keeps giving error. FIX IT PLEASE, as it could be really handy"
