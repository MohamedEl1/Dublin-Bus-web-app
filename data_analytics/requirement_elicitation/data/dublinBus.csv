0,Soufiane Boutaib,1,"January 26, 2020",6,Horrible . So I was in Cafe like 10 min walk to bus stop . And bc it so cold I decide to use this app to keep tracking time on 65 bus . First it was showing 20 min to come then after 5 or 7 min I check again it says 35 mins I was like oh ok strange . Then after 5 min I check again the 65 bus not on the list anymore . I run to bus stop and it seem this app played me up . Problem there is not even bus next hour . Next one is 2 hours after . In this cold night and horrible waiting after work :(
1,Susan Ann O'Brien,1,"March 14, 2020",0,"Very different and frustrating with the 75bus route , as I use that service all the time, and for example , I was waiting on my bus early morning time and it was due when I got to the bus due in 5mins and that bus never came I had sit there &amp; wait for another half hour sometimes it's , longer , I use this bus to go to deangrange , Stillorgan St John's of God's Where I have a mother whom has very serious health problems 10wks she's there now , before she was in Michael's hospital Dunlaoghaire. ðŸ˜“"
2,Terrahawk78,1,"September 12, 2019",8,"Your app only works 70% of the time. Seems to have trouble around busy times which is obviously when it's needed. Also, random quiet times. Don't try to make excuses as I've had several friends try their phones at 21:30 at night... same results. Also, not sure if it's you or Dublin bus but sometimes it counts down minutes to arrival on a bus which never appears. Basically these things considered, your app is pointless and need not exist. App deserves -8"
3,Paul McMahon,3,"May 7, 2019",26,"The update brings a nicer interface, but maps still dont work properly. When on a bus stop and click show on map, the app just closes. When looking at a route map under timetable, Am seeing the page cant load google maps correctly, and map then only shows in small section of screen."
4,Akash Mandal,4,"February 26, 2020",0,This app provides realtime and accurate information. Yet .... - need to be a lot faster - add features like sharing timetable to others
5,Marie Murray,3,"September 1, 2019",2,"great app: Except for:- Google maps does not work from timetables. Big problem when planning trip... Need to find stop, its number etc. Map is greyed out, you can see with difficulty, but slow to respond. Would give more stars if fixed."
6,Erica Dawn Bloom Pettersson,1,"December 6, 2019",6,Both bus apps are useless because the routes are changed around and the 2 apps for the 2 services in Dublin don't interact. The times and locations are wrong sometimes too and the site navigation is hard. I found the Moovit app thank God that interacts with the 2 bus service companies and the luas and the dart and also asks the PUBLIC to help. It works great.
7,SeÃ¡n Freeman,1,"May 9, 2019",7,"Long awaited update still hasn't fixed the 'show on map' button for specific stops. App should at least dispaly an error or fail gracefully rather than close completely, if you're gona release an update you should prioritise outstanding issues!"
8,Jeroen Treurniet,1,"June 15, 2019",1,"As someone visiting Dublin, I figured this app would be helpful... But it really isn't. It's too difficult to navigate and use. Directions on Google Maps are infinitely more useful."
9,John Kelly,1,"July 1, 2019",11,"Dreadful app. Did a search on route 114 which I use on a frequent basis. It replied ""No such route"". I then did a search on Stop 3200 which I also use frequently. It replied ""No information"". Jeez guys, why release an app whrn it's useless."
10,Stephen O'Neill,1,"July 3, 2019",11,useless app along with a useless service!!! apparently there isnt even a 76 available... nor does it show up. this is goin on years!! only to be met with ignorance by anyone of the people i talked to bar a select few.
11,Fabio Melillo,1,"March 6, 2020",1,So it says there's no bus coming for 20 minutes so I decided to take it slow and as I'm a few hundred metres away from the bus stop I see the bus coming and I missed it because if it told me there was actually going to be a bus I would have made it to the bus stop but no there was no bus for 20 minutes apparently f you
12,Ciaran Cotter,1,"October 4, 2018",1,"Worst app possible. Never accurate. Says busses have arrived when they have not, times are wrong 90% of the time. New bus routes and timetables have not been updated. Do not use."
13,Paul Carkery Moggy Arts,5,"July 29, 2019",5,"This is my personal favourite of the Dublin Bus Apps, it shows real time based bus times for arrival and how long you will have to wait for the next bus, recommend this to everyone who needs a bus..."
14,Joey TatÃº,5,"May 7, 2019",36,The app itself is good. However the information provided to the app via Transport for Ireland is not always accurate. But I don't think this is a Dublin Bus issue.
15,A Google user,1,"September 19, 2018",0,"It simply doesn't load in most cases looping on ""getting stops"" and so on, even over 4G. The app doesn't work."
16,Have Fun,1,"December 4, 2019",9,"This app is not worth even one star, there was supposed to be a bus 2 minutes ago (although it said due on the app) but there was no bus and it just disappeared from time table (within the app). So disappointed ðŸ˜¥"
17,Jim Archbold,1,"December 17, 2019",1,Difficult to navigate. Route 75 impossible to find. A lot of work needed to improve the users experienced. ðŸ¤¬
18,Trio M,1,"December 6, 2019",3,When it works it will give you live info however lately these incidents are rare. Interface is clumsy and some routes ie the 75 is not actually included in the list of routes.
19,Alice S,2,"October 2, 2018",1,"Worked great until yesterday. Since then, there's been no real time info whatsoever in Swords."
20,NIKE DiSamotracia,2,"October 3, 2018",0,When I try to see the stops on a route I am told that the map is for development purpose only and I can't see as I could before. Can you check it please ?
21,Alan Duffy,3,"June 19, 2019",1,"Too little too late with the Android 9 compatibility, almost a year after the OS release do Dublin bus get their act together. Moved to another app with more features including Widgets."
22,Muireann TÃ³ibÃ­n,1,"September 27, 2019",6,Why do you need my location? The previous version of this app worked fine without a requirement to know my location. The new version shuts down if I deny this permission. Can't see why this was changed. App uninstalled.
23,Florent Serra,1,"November 5, 2019",2,The 747 route map is still not up to date.. Great way to get an extra stress boost before a flight.
24,Inga Garastaite,1,"September 21, 2018",1,Never shows correct time. Loads of ghost busses and always crashes. This app is a mess not whort it.
25,Thad Castle,2,"August 29, 2019",1,Pretty ridiculous that the private operated routes have disappeared. And even some other ones. 46a no longer exists according to the app
26,Kieran Burke,5,"October 4, 2018",4,Gets it fairly right most of the time. But don't walk away from the stop if the bus hasn't arrived on spec.. give it a few minutes.
27,Lorna Nolan,1,"December 12, 2019",3,"It stopped working and doesn't give times bus is too arrive at stop, so frustrating!!!!"
28,Sean Butler,2,"December 10, 2019",1,"""Sorry, real-time information is currently unavailable for this review"""
29,Christopher Delso,1,"October 6, 2019",1,"Route map did not account for temporary rerouting, just showed the original route."
30,elf_ fornite,5,"November 7, 2019",27,I think this is a good apo because you can see the time the bus is coming at and you can see all the Dublin buses. Recommended app.
31,Enes Dogan,1,"February 12, 2020",0,Inaccurare Thought an official app would give official *real time* as they claim arrival times. Save your time. Don't download same time on google maps but both are incorrect
32,Lauren Brizzolara,1,"July 1, 2019",2,"App didn't work - told me there were no results when I entered bus stop number, route number, etc"
33,Artur Albrecht,1,"January 12, 2020",0,"One of the, if not the worst transport apps ever. Just never works."
34,Evelyn Keely,1,"November 19, 2019",1,Update needed in 747 route standing like an idiot on Lord Edward street could easily have missed flight....route along the Quays is a much better route anyway cuts at least 10mins off journey
35,Anthony O'Connell,1,"November 12, 2019",2,The 75 bus will not come up on the app and my friend has an iPhone and the 75 comes up on hers at the same stop !
36,luca onorante,1,"August 6, 2019",2,NO way to plan a trip. Just a list of stops and bus numbers. Map function meaningless
37,Michael Coyle,1,"May 7, 2019",3,crashes every time when I click 'show on map'
38,Eric Shadowens,1,"September 22, 2019",0,"Only works once in a while, of course shocking when you actually need it. No wonder they brought in other bus companies. Dublin Bus is clearly has no idea what they're doing other than taking Union wages"
39,Aoife Onora Fagan,1,"May 23, 2019",0,I just waited over 40 minutes for what was meant to be a 10 minute wait. this happens regularly
40,A Google user,2,"September 18, 2018",0,"DEFINATELY NOT REAL TIME INFORMATION! was told by app bus was due in 2 minutes, 15 minutes later bus arrives...absolute nonsense"
41,Joseph,4,"September 24, 2018",4,"Works very well, about maybe 90% of the time."
42,Stefan Tonge,2,"May 7, 2019",6,The app crashes everytime I use the map function!
43,Foggy,3,"December 5, 2019",0,"Good, but 17 timings to stops are not shown?"
44,atif daar,1,"September 14, 2019",0,It's a use less app. Never shows the fare that we have to pay.
45,John Clow,3,"May 10, 2019",1,sometimes is not working properly. delay...
46,DÃ­oma Murphy-Rourke,1,"October 2, 2018",1,Extremely slow and inaccurate 8/10 times

51,Kealan Reddington,2,"January 4, 2020",0,"Please stop asking for location access, it is not needed"
52,Justus Lazar,4,"May 7, 2019",0,Good app but can be better!! ðŸ™‚
53,Craig Kilpatrick,1,"June 1, 2019",0,Still does not work. Absolutely pointless.
54,Ole zin,3,"June 17, 2019",1,search by bus stop doesn't work
55,Brown Coat,1,"September 26, 2019",0,"No route maps, if you don't already know how to get where you want to go this won't help."
56,Arthur Irishyouth,5,"May 11, 2019",2,Glad to see this app came back best Dublin bus app around
57,John Donohoe,5,"February 26, 2020",0,This is the best for buses
58,A Google user,3,"September 27, 2018",0,Buses always late . Its meant to be real time so how does a bus go from due to me still standing there 20 minutes later when it didn't pass me.
59,bla bla,1,"November 9, 2019",0,There is no some lines like 18 in this app... Terible app dont use it
60,Conor Keohane,4,"August 8, 2019",0,very easy to use
61,Stuart Yeomans,1,"June 14, 2019",0,Rarely ever actually works
62,Patricia Murray,4,"October 9, 2019",0,The app is always right
63,Derek Byrne,3,"September 27, 2018",0,It's ok but you don't feel like you can 100% trust and that's kinda not good !
64,Mary Alagna,5,"June 11, 2019",2,"haven't tried it properly, but new update seems great"
65,Lee O'Connor,1,"September 19, 2019",0,"Buses never on time. Overpriced, overcrowded and dirty. Drivers are arrogant overpaid lazy idiots. You'd have better odds of winning the lotto than a Dublin bus turing up on time! Disgraceful."
66,No Name,1,"October 9, 2019",0,"Demonstration in city centre apparently on 9 October 2019 closed the Westland Row stop for an hour but the real time display shows normal times, people were waiting for nothing as buses just drove by. Incompetency from drivers and RTPI."
67,Eoin Kavanagh,5,"July 7, 2019",0,this disappeared off the play store for a while
68,Jennifer Brennan,1,"February 24, 2020",0,Doesn't have all bus routes on it
69,Pablo,1,"July 14, 2019",3,"costing me 30 mins plus of my life daily. bus 5min away... go to stop.. 1 min away.... get money ready. nothing arrives. looks back at app, 30min till arrival ðŸ˜¡ every day same b.s. dont bother"

104,A Google user,1,"December 17, 2017",22,It good during its brilliant during the day. But at night I as getting the first 83 bus stop and no bus came and it said a bus came. About 4 busses finished and I was waiting for it to start again and about 5 BUSSES PASSED AND NEVER STARTED AGAIN AND HAD TO WAIT ABOUT AN HOUR FOR A BUS TO COME AND ABOUTH THE 6TH OR 7NTH BUS STOPPED AND AND STARTED AGAIN I THINK THIS IS DISGREASFULL
105,Brett Irish,1,"March 12, 2018",16,This app couldn't be any less accurate if it tried. 90% of the time it won't find any real time info for a bus. And when it does find bus times its not even close to being accurate. A minute on the app takes about 2 or 3 minutes in real time. You would be more accurate simply guessing the bus times than using this app.
106,Mary O'Carroll,5,"June 28, 2016",60,Today route 39a is called No.3 on App.
107,Paul Doran,2,"November 7, 2016",36,Not great
108,David Burton,1,"February 16, 2018",6,"Constantly unable to return lists of routes, stops, favourites lists etc.   Crashes very regularly when trying to do basic tasks such as check out a route.   Consistently returns incorrect information. Very unreliable.   Learning off a bus timetable will save you more hassle than using this app."
109,Ian Crossan,1,"August 24, 2016",6,You have to know the bus stop
110,Nakendraraj Devaraj,3,"October 8, 2016",11,NO REAL TIME INFORMATION
111,Anthony Fox,1,"March 15, 2018",0,This is false advertisement. Real time info my ass. The app updates almost every second day but they never once updated it to have real time information. Never accurate and combined with what a useless service Dublin bus is this app essentially guesses when a bus might be due and is still wrong. Slow clap for Dublin bus and the app developers. I'm sure they got paid handsomely for this turd of an app
112,Anonymous,5,"September 22, 2017",4,"Super perfect I've just relocated to Ireland and I have to say that this app is awesome.  I used the live info today and it did not only tell me what buses that used the stop, but also the correct time to departure. And this was during rush hour. Great app."
113,Thomas Byrne,1,"April 19, 2018",0,"Infuriating! App was way off giving correct times for the 33b today.... 
Ended up missing it twice (return journey) and almost 3 hours late home 
(remote service into Portrane) - Not happy , ZERO stars"
114,Prophet Damiclee,2,"July 27, 2016",19,Bus times never showing
115,Georges Van Cauwenbergh,1,"October 19, 2016",2,This app is not woth it
116,Max Brennan,3,"April 6, 2017",4,"If you want to figure out in what general millennia your bus is coming in, congrats, you found your app. But if you want to know if it is coming in the next 10 minutes, good luck. Oh so many a time have I checked the app for it to tell me the next bus is in 30 minutes, then just as I'm about to reach my stop a minute later, the bus flies past me and my stop."
117,Dean B,4,"July 29, 2016",4,Could really benefit from street view support.
118,Damian Reilly,2,"December 12, 2017",1,Who is in charge of setting the bus times and routes??? Absolutely dreadful planning!!! I get the 123 bus home after work and sometimes I need to wait 25mins for a bus because 2 (sometimes even 3!) come at the same time and I miss them!!! Why do more than 1 of the same buses start their journeys at the same time?!?!?! The app itself is fine. Just the planning on behalf of Dublin Bus is woeful. Sort it out!
119,Maurice Gavin,2,"February 14, 2018",3,"The quality of the real time traffic data is poor that it's essentially useless on many routes. There has been no perceptible improvement to it in years. Error handling is poor at times, especially when buses cannot be retrieved at all, and the UI could do with a facelift. The interfaces problems could be overlooked if the data within was accurate."
120,Jonathan Keenaghan,1,"December 23, 2016",2,Real time DOES NOT work. Skipping!!
121,Mlitwa Sbongi,1,"October 7, 2016",2,Very annoying app
122,Eoin O' Leary,1,"March 24, 2017",4,"As I stand here at the bus stop on Amiens Street, I'd really like it if your app represented, in any way, reality. I've seen ghost 14s pass by for 30 minutes now and am currently looking at a 14 that hasn't moved past 6 minutes for a good 20 minutes. Either your buses are completely detached from reality or your app is."
123,victor keane,1,"November 22, 2016",3,Terrible
124,Laura Lee,1,"March 28, 2018",1,2 days in a row now the Real time isn't working and it's nothing to do with my internet. Absolute joke. Sort it out! Missed my bus yesterday and more than like miss it today aswell!
125,Amanda G.,2,"March 20, 2018",1,"It's good when it works, but at times is just useles s. Sometimes you're waiting for the bus and all of a sudden it disappears. Not to mention when it's just a regular weekday and it comes up as ""no info available""."
126,Pat Rooney,3,"September 21, 2017",2,"Middling at best. Could be so much better.  Too much reliance on stop numbers for simple queries. These are of very limited usefulness, especially for visitors.  Also, searches often come to an inexplicable dead end, with the app seeking your direction of travel, but giving you only a blank screen below the request and no means of progressing.  Maybe somebody in Dublin Bus could iron out the wrinkles in this app?  It has a lot of unrealised potential."
127,Sasank Gorrepati,3,"November 2, 2016",2,Why it is slow on android mobile?
128,Adam Ryk,1,"April 20, 2018",1,"This app is truly rubbish. So often the real time service is down, and it 
isn't my connection. I've checked the real time website and it's also down. 
This app does not fulfil its main purpose. Enough said"
129,Pat Scanlan,3,"January 26, 2017",3,the map view not good anymore. doesn't show any bus stops as push pins like it did  ...please attend to this....
130,Fintan .Guihen,2,"December 14, 2017",1,"unreliable.  good, but only when it works. often it can't find any routes or stops.useless if you're in a hurry"
131,Paul Conway,1,"September 1, 2017",3,"App crashes on individual stop ""show on map"" every time. Happens on two different phones, both have latest update."
132,Mary o Carroll,1,"July 2, 2016",8,"More problems. Several routes only show the first digit of the route number. eg.no.39a  is shown as 3.. Difficult to read the name of the stops.   When I now click on 'show on map' the app closes down.  I reported it to Dublin Bus but no change, I will be downloading a better app. today."
133,Rich Mangan,1,"March 19, 2017",2,"I wish we had a good quality Dublin bus app. This one really is quite poor.  The ""Search by stop number"" doesn't recognise input so you need to just scroll endlessly until you find the number you're looking for (there's thousands of listings!)  The text is too small and the overall experience is very cluttered and confusing. Some pages don't allow zooming and the text is tiny. Too much information presented to the user who may be looking for something simple. Needs better organisation/UI/UX."
134,Faizan Zahid,1,"September 3, 2017",2,"Worst app ever. False realtime info I waited for it and believed on the realtime values for bus 11, it didn't come and wasted my time."
135,Christopher Smith,1,"April 13, 2017",3,"Rubbish app but hardly surprising from a rubbish company. Anytime you go to show on map the app crashes, I suppose they've no money to fix the bugs as they have to pay the drivers way too much or they just strike over and over again. Useless App, Useless Company with parasites as staff."
136,Ruthie Brady,2,"December 20, 2016",3,"The buses just disappear from the real time, says 2 minutes then disappears and says 10 minutes. It's very frustrating, defeats the purpose of the app and makes me late!!!"
137,Stephen Graham,1,"May 13, 2018",0,"This app is great! 10% of the time that is, when it actually works. The 
other 90% of the time it's 'being updated' or just totally wrong. Waste of 
memory."
138,Andrej TomiÄ‡,1,"June 8, 2018",0,"This is the most idiotic app in work. 50% of time I can't even check the 
stops."
139,A Google user,4,"March 10, 2017",1,"Pretty decent but I think it could benefit from a few other features like either Google backup (so you don't lose your favorites if you need to reinstall app / install to a new device and improved caching . Still, it's free and mostly reliable"
140,C,1,"July 2, 2017",2,"Disgrace that major functions do not work, such as searching for bus numbers (have to scroll through a list), searching for location etc. The fact that this was publicly funded makes it more irritating, this would not happen in the UK or Berlin."
141,Ruth Stephenson,3,"May 17, 2017",2,"When the waiting time at a stop gets close to arrival of the bus, the bus completely disappears off the app. Sometimes I think I've missed a bus and had to take a taxi when all that happened was the app didn't show the bus! Happens all the time"
142,Philip OReilly,3,"February 9, 2017",1,"Would have gave 5 only its seems to operate by the timetables so isn't the most accurate. May I suggest operating by a GPS tracker on the bus, then it will tell you exactly how many mins away it is,. I've just stood in the freezing cold for over 20 mins for a bus that was ment to be 9 mins"
143,A Google user,1,"August 1, 2017",1,I wrote the review just 2 mins ago but it got deleted. Riding a camel would be more accurate and would have brought me places quicker
144,Lee Callaghan,2,"November 21, 2017",0,Simply one of the worst apps I have ever used on multiple occasions buses tend to disappear off the real time or are just not shown at all pathetic really and because of this I've been late for college on more than on occasion. This app needs some serious work and even with internet connection it says it cannot find real time for stops.
145,Gabriela Keller,3,"March 28, 2018",0,Since yesterday it stopped working. It says no real time info for that stop. ALL THE STOPS during the day with plenty of internet. Very frustrating.

154,Gabor Sipkoi,2,"July 25, 2018",0,"What's the reason befor all the mystery with Dublin bus routes? I can't find any app or website where I can point to two places in the map and it returns the bus routes connecting them. This App is an example: it allows you to search by bus stop number, but there are situations when you don't know the bus stop number and would prefer to simply point on the map. It's true the app has an option to search by address by that ends up returning a list of bus stop numbers which is useless most of the times.  It's definitely not an easy and straightforward app to use.  Another thing Iâ€™d like to point: there are at least two bus routes from the airport to the city centre (747 and 41). But for any combination Iâ€™ve tried, this app only gives you the most expensive option (route 747)."
155,Dawid Bielecki,2,"September 26, 2017",0,The real time information is not accurate. Said my bus will be in 10 minutes and it took me 2 minutes to get to the bus stop and the bus was already gone.

I waited nearly 30 mins for another, missed my connecting train. Highly 
annoying"

167,Lee G,3,"March 6, 2017",3,This app has used 3.6gb of data in the last 3 days. Seriously what's going on here? I have screen shots to submit if you need them Devs.
168,Hugh Pearse,3,"June 11, 2017",0,"There are a number of problems with this application. (1.) When performing a search by stop number or by route, the entire real time data set is downloaded to the phone which is very slow. Why is a search query not sent first from the phone to the server and respond with a smaller amount of data? (2.) When viewing a bus stop the app displays a list of routes which can not be clicked. Why not allow the user to open it and display a list of more stops for that route? (3.) Why can only stops be added to favorites and not routes?.  (4.) Why can alerts not be set for individual routes passing a stop? When it is raining especially, nobody wants to stand outside in the rain, but they also don't want to miss a bus that only passes twice a day. (5.) Why are the static timetables not displayed as well as the real time information? When the real time server is down for unscheduled maintenance then the app is completely useless.   Overall this app demonstrates a lack of software design, planning which is demonstrated by a lack of basic usability. Made by people who never took a bus in their life. Where did the developers get the non functional requirements? It works, but not well."

171,A Google user,2,"January 26, 2018",0,It only works over wifi. For some reason it is downloading the whole list of stops or bus lines every time. Even putting the bus stop number you are standing at won't work unless the whole list manage to get downloaded. It's impossible to check  when buses are coming while not on wifi.

Majority of the time I check it it's unavailable or apparently no bus routes exist...usually have to reset the app a few times before I can check a bus time. Probably quicker walking down to the bus stop and checking it there
330,Moira Reilly,3,"March 3, 2016",0,"When it works it's great, but you cannot depend on it. Frequently will not show stop information, often when it worked fine minutes before, resulting in guess work and waiting ages outside for buses. Also, if you close it and go to open another app, like Facebook, Dublin Bus will pop up again!"
331,Bruno Martins,1,"September 1, 2015",0,Worst of the  bus apps
332,TomÃ¡Å¡ PolÃ¡k,3,"January 27, 2016",0,"Could be so much better, if it tried to go beyond the website functionality.  The most annoying is that it always reads the full list of bus stops and full list of routes from the internet, which is with 2G connection really a pain. Come on - why you don't save it locally and compare just some kind of hash value and redownload on change only. Can't be that hard to implement."
333,A Google user,3,"December 23, 2014",5,Very rough around the edges
334,Dave Murphy,2,"April 11, 2016",1,"As a whole, can't fault the app. Dies what it says on the tin but the 'Real Time Information' section is a disgrace. Frequently buses just drop-off and disappear while '2mins' all top often becomes '10mins' which begs the question , how is your 'real time' data actually calculated? 30 minutes today waiting for a bus that was supposedly 5 minutes away!!"
335,Raymond Dowe,2,"May 27, 2016",0,What a joke
336,Shane O Brien,4,"January 20, 2015",10,"The app is great,  it's a contender for my most frequently used app. Remember the old days,  when you used to have to stand in the cold,  blindly waiting for a bus like a chump? No more! Well,  except for those times when the app predicts a bus in 5 minutes and you step outside,  trusting smile on your face,  only to discover upon reloading the stop information that the bus in question never existed and you now have to wait around in the cold for 15 minutes. Like a chump. But they're rare enough."

If it's definitely being rerouted, then let us know! More than once has a rerouted bus found its way back on route, but not shown up on the app. This inconsistency is really annoying and wastes a lot of time. Just put ""rerouted"" next to the rerouted bus and you'll have a lot more happy commuters."

345,Paul Archbold,2,"March 27, 2016",0,When I use the app to see where my bus for work in the morning is I'm usually told 20 mins so I leave my house to go to bus stop 10mins away and said bus will be either just pulling up or pulling away. 9/10 times this happens and I'm then left waiting for an additional 30 minutes for the next. Also I feel like the app should be fitted with a notification that there is already a wheelchair user on board or full to capicity with baby prams.

358,Ceire Hoey,3,"July 28, 2015",1,"Its a good app if you know the bus routes, otherwise there's a lot of working it out yourself.

574,Ximo PL,2,"January 6, 2014",0,"It is useful to get I info about the next buses if you are in a stop without real-time panel.   This app it is devoted to real-time info. It's difficult to know the exact routes of the buses. For a map of Dublin with the routes you must go to the webpage. Furthermore, nothing seems to be cached and internet connection is required. From time to time there's an outage and not even the nearest stop info works."
575,Alier Ajuong,3,"September 27, 2013",6,"Great idea almost pulled it off.  I wonder what's the story with these ghost buses floating around? Many times a bus will be approaching your stop, you can even track its arrival time from the previous stops  only for it to completely disappesr off the list? Off the top of my head 11 has disappeared before reaching #3023 and 46a before 847"
576,Sarah B,3,"January 30, 2013",5,"When it works, it's pretty good.  HOWEVER it very regularly stops working and you get the ""Realtime information not available for this stop"" message for every stop you try, or upcoming buses regularly disappear and occasionally reappear 20 minutes later, and of couse there are stops where the route has changed and the bus no longer passes them, but the app still predicts that the old bus is coming.  That's a lot of fun on a rainy day."

I ended up having to get a taxi that I could not afford., leaving me and my very young family getting home at all hours last night. I'm so annoyed with this app. Epic fail....... Continued....now buses that are hourly only are appearing and then disappearing, I get ready to go, cancel, then the bus appears....this app gets worse."

583,Patrick Flynn,1,"March 24, 2013",3,Terrible
584,Stephen Phillips,3,"November 28, 2013",0,"This app is a very good concept and well designed. It's big failing however it is loading in the data for the bus stops and routes every time you use it which makes it very unreliable at times, especially on a 3g connection. If it had all the data loaded into the app it would be a LOT faster and would be the best bus app of all time. Would be 5 stars if not for the reliability issue."
585,A Google user,3,"September 8, 2013",1,"It will be very hard for you to find the correct bus. This app is useful when you know the route number and want to find its stops, timing, etc. If you don't, it's a trial and error clicking a map until you find an appropriate route. It should have an option to tell the app: I'm going to this point, and then it tells you the possible routes based on your location."

587,Kevin Nolan,2,"December 21, 2013",1,Pretty pointless when buses just disappear and you're stuck waiting for the next one.
