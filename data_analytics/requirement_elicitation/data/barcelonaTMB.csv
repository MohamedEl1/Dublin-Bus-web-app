0,Mihai,1,"January 26, 2020",3,Primitive app. Journey planner shows you the trip but no button to buy a ticket for that trip. The buy tickets menu shows a lot of options but you have no clue which one matches your journey. Somehow there seems to be no logic or usability behind the programming of the app.
1,Simon Zhapa,1,"February 16, 2020",1,Downloaded this app while being in Tibidabo and bought 3 T-Casual tickets using this app. They offered me a code which I needed to print the tickets in the ticket machines (so far ok).After paying for one single-journey ticket and going to the Funicular (bus driver didn't recognize the app) the officer didn't know how to print the tickets in the machine and told me to go to Provenca??Paid 2nd ticket and still no-one could help me with the code. In the end spent more money and asked for refund.
2,Luca Gentile,4,"February 10, 2020",0,They should make a digital ticket that you can buy (AND USE) straight from this app. The use of shared bicycles should be included.
3,Sylwia Karina,5,"January 1, 2020",0,Great official app for the public transport in Barcelona. Good way to buy tickets for transport in advance. Only sometimes is not showing the options how to get to favourite destinations while few weeks ago was working perfectly.
4,A Google user,1,"February 18, 2019",1,"Broken, type in a local train station and it gives options in different parts of the country. Struggles to recognise that you are at a station. Input two stations next to each other on same line. App advises you to walk from metro station to a bus stop instead of train arriving in 3 minutes. Other much better apps out there. Edit for response from app developer 2onths later. What do you mean you have no notice of any problems? do you not read the Google reviews for your rubbish app!?"
5,TheNinjaMarmot,4,"May 19, 2019",5,Pleasantly surprised. Quite a decent app. Quite easy to do certain things. It didnt bring any search results for Park Guell. But quite useful nethertheless.
6,Zeeshaan Lakdawala,1,"May 31, 2019",20,Pointless and misleading. You still have to pickup your ticket at the vending machine if you buy one through the app. This makes it totally useless.
7,Darko Petrovic,1,"January 26, 2019",3,Total rubish app. Completly useless. I don't get it how did city of Barcelona allowed this to happen. Terible first impresion about the city. btw. Account activation still pending - an hour after registration. Unebeliveble pain in the ass app
8,Pavel Dudek,4,"June 29, 2019",2,"Good app for finding routes throughout the city. Just, why are night buses not included?"
9,shan shan tew,1,"October 11, 2019",2,"Just bought a T10 ticket then the app keep exiting, unable to check the deadline for collection"
10,Andrea Florio,3,"January 29, 2019",1,It should give you the time when a but/train is supposed to arrive not just the eximated length of the trip. No time tables available
11,Stefan Gangefors,1,"November 29, 2018",0,Trying to register an account but no activation email is sent out. Been 20 minutes now.
12,MichaÅ‚ Michalski,1,"September 6, 2019",2,"I can only see main menu, clicking on anything crashes the app."
13,Germano Souza,1,"September 29, 2018",0,It doesn't work. The website works much better

26,Jordi Monedero Boado,4,"November 13, 2019",0,Perfecta para comprar con el tfn
27,Jacques Movil,3,"October 7, 2019",0,Es una buena app pero es lamentable que no consigue encontrar una ruta ente 2 paradas de bus (459 y 3185) aunque tenga el nÃºmero de conexiones a 10. Hola TMB.. no tengo forma de contestar a vuestro comentario por lo que lo hago de esta forma: Si da una ruta entre mÃ¡s 2 paradas pero hay que andar a/desde otra parada del que estoy buscando. Creo que tiene que ver con que solo muestra las 5 mÃ¡s rÃ¡pidas. IrÃ­a bien tener la opciÃ³n ordenar por cercanÃ­a de parada.
28,VÃ­ctor LÃ³pez,5,"August 16, 2019",5,Good app.
29,A Google user,5,"April 27, 2019",2,"Quin gust.. perfi una aplicaciÃ³ decent. Ara nomÃ©s falta la T-Mobilitat d'una p vegada i haver de deixar de comprar targetes que nomÃ©s serveixen per generar brossa. Estaria molt bÃ© integraciÃ³ amb les lÃ­nies de ferrocarril, alguns no tenim metro al barri i el bus va lent per culpa dels cotxes."
30,Eva,2,"March 20, 2019",0,"Ara bÃ©, l'app Ã©s maca perÃ² li queda molta funcionalitat per afegir. Estaria bÃ© que incloguÃ©s les lÃ­nies de Bus de l'AMB (Busos, per exemple, B20 o B25...). Hi ha molts codis de parada de bus que no els troba."
31,Henry C,3,"September 8, 2018",1,"0% functionality if my mobile is completely offlined. As a tourist, it's useful to have the transit maps downloadable"
32,Laercio Azevedo,1,"September 3, 2018",0,"I cannot login using Google or FB account just get message ""authenting"". I tried to trace a route and no address is found"
33,Tom Ross,3,"April 14, 2018",0,"OK if you want the app to dictate which route to take based on time but 
hopeless if you want to chose a route based on other criteria and save it. 
For example I wanted to chose routes to/from from the airport using my T10 
card but the app only gives routes based on time. Citymapper turned out to 
be much more helpful for my needs."
34,VnW Travels,5,"January 27, 2018",0,A great app that we were able to start using straight away. Really liked the ability to save favourite places and the detailed written breakdown of the chosen route with interactive map to keep you on course. It made travel in Barcelona stress free.
35,A Google user,1,"May 1, 2018",1,"Why make me sign up when all I need is routes, as a tourist I don't want to 
sign up for simething I'll use once. Also, the email confirmation did'nt 
come through. Deleting app."
36,Prasad Adhav,4,"December 4, 2017",4,"The app is really good. You get the routes on map, bus stops, all the buses going through that bus stop. It also tells the expected arrival time. The only  drawback is it needs net access."
37,A Google user,1,"December 11, 2017",1,"A public information app that forces you to sign up. Genius. And no, I don't want a ""personalized experience"" to just see the maps and the route planner does not need to know anything about me besides the origin and destination. Uninstalled."
38,Quintie Bouwens,1,"November 1, 2017",0,Una kk. No funciona. Te obliga a registrarte y te lleva a una pÃ¡gina web que no funciona. No he conseguido que funcione. Lo desistalo sin haberlo podido usar.

40,Bert Ram,1,"October 17, 2017",1,dont buy the online voucher! you need to print it at a ticket vending machine anyway. no departure times on routes visible! use google maps instead....
41,Matthew Wilkes,1,"October 17, 2017",1,Mandatory sign up
42,Sophia Cho,1,"October 4, 2017",2,I bought two tickets from this app. But I cannot print it and no purchasing information is stored in the app. No email was sent to my phone. I had to buy two new tickets from the Metro office. Even the customer service refused to reply my phone. I cannot get back my money!!
43,A Google user,2,"September 11, 2017",5,"One of the worst public transport apps I have seen so far.  - To use it one needs to register on an unknown website - why ?! Please, please developers study the Android API to use a local or cloud-synced storage for data and don grab the users email for a useless account.  - It is nearly impossible to plan a journey with a target address as the ""adress replacement"" functionality simply does not work - one will end up in a endless loop in the app.  - Metro sems not to be included - why not?  I don't understand why this app is so bad, their website is much better and especially provides all options for a good journey planning."
44,Marco Ceresa,1,"September 18, 2017",3,Mandatory sign up?? Ridiculous. Uninstalled immediately.

El segÃ¼ent cop que l'obro ja funciona bÃ©. AixÃ­ cada cop que vull entrar, tinc que passar per aquest procÃ©s d'obrir, tancar i tornar a obrir. 2) La secciÃ³ de favorits, on es poden guardar les parades mÃ©s utilitzades, Ã©s una opciÃ³ bÃ sica ja que permet fer servir l'aplicaciÃ³ de forma molt mÃ©s rÃ pida. El problema Ã©s que el 80% de les vegades que entro a la secciÃ³ de favorits estÃ  buida. Si ho provo uns quants cops mÃ©s, al final acaben sortint les parades. En fi, m'imagino que tindrÃ  altres problemes, perÃ² aquests dos sÃ³n tan grans que no entenc com no poden estar solucionats a hores d'ara. El meu mÃ²bil Ã©s un Sony Xperia Arc S (Android 2.3.4).
