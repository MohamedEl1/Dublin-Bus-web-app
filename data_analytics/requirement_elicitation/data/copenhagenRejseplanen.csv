0,TaliiLars,5,"June 9, 2020",0,Absolutely practical. Essential when moving around uncharted seas.
1,Ezekiel Stary,1,"April 23, 2020",2,App asks for location and contacts permissions. Then it crashes. Unusable in current state.
2,Wan Bunde,5,"June 3, 2020",0,Great app. Easy to usd even for non Danes.
3,Azhar Tahir Dodhy,4,"April 9, 2020",0,Good app but from norebro to copenhagen center 5C bus is not shown... :-)
4,Phillip Andreasen,1,"April 27, 2020",0,It crashes when I open it so it is trash at the moment
5,Chris Chemnitz,1,"April 25, 2020",1,App keeps crashing when it boots
6,Alessandro D'Ambrosio,3,"January 6, 2020",1,"This app works perfectly when all the transportation system works as usual. However, when a train is cancelled, the app shows that the train isn't running but it doesn't provide alternative options. Therefore, there is the risk of having a list of cancelled trains in the results, without having alternatives that involve other transportation means, such as buses."
7,a a,1,"January 6, 2020",5,"The app is utterly useless every time there's a disruption in public transports. As it happens literally every second day on the S-Trains (DSB's ineptitude is becoming legendary), the app doesn't help. It just add irritating messages to the ""normal"" choices, not offering viable options. Moreover, lately the timetable is sometime plainly wrong, leaving people stranded during the night... It needs to rebuild trust in the app from scratch, because it used to be decent."
8,John Smith,1,"February 21, 2020",1,"EDIT: This app keeps doing location requests when not open. 0/10, a privacy nightmare. Hey Rejseplanen! I see that notification that disappears within a second while your app is closed. Not cool to skim my data like that. It also manages to consistently find the least efficient route possible."
9,Allan,4,"December 29, 2019",5,"This app does a good job by helping travel with public transporation in dennark. Could be better if it had better support for traveling abroad the danish border. With a close integration with the german app ""DB Navigator"" to make traveling between locations in denmark and locations in germany i would give the app 5 stars. A relative big use case in the time where we want to reduce co2 foorprint and let people to take the train to europe instead of airplanes."
10,Alan Cebohín,5,"February 1, 2020",0,"Awesome app, you have everything you need to stay quiet and comfortable. It's even more awesome if you are new in town and don't understand so much how to travel. Five stars for this developers team!"
11,David Braae,2,"December 22, 2019",1,"Annoying that when you scroll the page slightly, it snaps to the top or bottom, when I want to be able to decide which parts I want to see. Also annoying when it scrolls to the top when you choose to see later or earlier travel options"
12,B Kristensen,2,"February 1, 2019",2,"not every departure is added to the app, which is frustrating when you want to plan your trip. The other day i wanted to go to town B from town A. - i used rejseplanen to check for departures when waiting at the station and only the train showed up as an option. I was puzzled to see the bus arrive heading for town B, how is that possible when not mentioned in rejseplanen? its not like it was a special occasion, no, this bus is regular. i have more examples, but no more space to use here."
13,Lucas Silveira,1,"October 1, 2019",0,"Don't be surprised if a metro line under maintenance is still recommended by the app. I also was recommended to board a train through a closed train station, the train still passed there but I could not get inside through the specific train station because it was closed for cleaning during that period. If the app simply redirected me to the other closest station, I would have not lost the train."
14,Matt Durbin,5,"February 17, 2019",5,Outstanding information and very easy to plan a route multiple ways. i use this almost every time i travel in Denmark no matter how short the distance. More cpuntries should use this app as an example of how to do it. it's in Danish but i can still follow it very easily and it is simple to use once you have done it a couple of times.
15,EskeRahn,4,"July 9, 2019",0,"The functionality in this app is very useful. Though it is far from perfect. Partly assumably because the traffic info it gets is lacking in accuracy. The geocoding of stops, at best, catches one side of the road correctly. You can be offered really strange micro movement walking directions Sometimes the app offers absurdly bad trip suggestions, especially at short distances, where walking would be much much faster. (Try e.g. Dybbølsbro to Fisketorvet at e.g. 03:00 ...)"
16,Anders Skaanning Andersen,1,"May 10, 2019",4,"poor gps update, way too long ""buffer time"" for walking and changing, making you miss most convenient routes. Poor map integration and the app forgets the journey you're on if you accidentally close it, and cannot regain it during travel. All in all, this app seems like something that was relevant ten years ago. Use Google maps instead."
17,Hristian Dro,1,"January 30, 2020",0,Since 6 months its not working at all.just keeps thinking and thinking and nothing. Last year was perfect -fast and reliable. Thank God there is Google Maps.
18,Κλαϊντι Α,3,"October 24, 2018",7,I would give 5 stars if it was more user-friendly. Sometimes it confuses you and you don't know what to do. Also please add more English and make it possible for English speakers to understand. There are more and more foreigners in Denmark and adding English would be a huge plus
19,Jon Bjarnasson,1,"June 2, 2019",2,"This app is veru difficult to use, you are always running into blindstreets. Select køb and you expect to enter your card info with 1-2 additional clicks to actually buy a ticket. That hasn't succeeded yet, neither with an dedicatet assistance person at Kastrup nor inborn Dane. Summary: You can in 1-2 trials learn to get directions and travelplan but buying a ticket is waste of time. Grade: 2/10"
20,Geoff Standland,5,"May 13, 2019",3,"Rejseplanen has becime a faithfull companion on my visits to copenhagen. Good instructions, maps and integration across the metro, bus and footpath network. the satelite position and tracking is a plus and like google maps but I think this functionality and interface are better. Thank you Rejseplanen, a great tool!"
21,Nicolai O,5,"January 7, 2020",0,"Great app. No downtime, optimized and very user friendly."
22,Eduardo Simões,1,"September 15, 2019",1,"The live map is fake. The clame to fame and the only one thing that is better than Google maps but turns out it is garbage. Buses are not running today, yet they still appear to be running live. Really a joke! Needs more English translations and the buses need to start to arrive on time."
23,Siudzix,1,"December 2, 2018",3,"Since the android 8.0 update for Samsung galaxy s7 edge (somewhere in april) The rejseplan widget is not working, it keeps showing blank page and crashing. Does anyone has similar issue? Edit: I switched phone to OnePlus 6t and this app doesn't even support it. It runs on Android 9. One star, sorry guys."
24,Kaspito [ESC],4,"September 5, 2019",0,"Good app stays updated most of the time. It's just too bad the Danish public transportation system sucks balls, daily delays of up to 20 minutes, but this app will often show the delay before it is even announced over the platform speakers."
25,Mennat Maassarani,4,"January 18, 2019",0,"The app is basic and simple to use yet, lots of improvements can be made to improve user experience. To a 90% this app is accurate but I sometime feel the urge to compare with other apps such as city mapper to get different options."
26,Lotte Rose Nielsen,1,"January 17, 2019",5,"The last couple of months it has crashed a lot, and for the past 2-3 weeks it won't even open - just shows a grey screen...reinstalling the app does not help.. Its annoying because I used to use it every day.. I'm using a sony xperia xz2 btw"
27,ProjectAlliance,2,"September 17, 2018",0,This app is good for telling you the shortest time and give you the longest and annoying road. The interface is absolute carbage. Hard to find around it. I lost 150 DDK FOR BUYING A TICKET Copenhagen. But it gave me wrong ticket 2 time!! Thos is useless
28,The Flying Matt,4,"February 22, 2020",0,"Great App, Platform information helps make a quick and easy transfer from 1 to the other"
29,Roberta Andrade,4,"January 22, 2019",2,since the new fynbus plan the 13th of January is not working proprely. doesnt show all the available rutes from where I am and the time! last week was caos for me to follow the buses. got home really late after work because of that! please check or update cus losing the buses in this weather is not fun!
30,Nikoletta Stylianidi,5,"April 3, 2019",0,I haven't experienced any problem with the app and I have been using it for 4 months now. It's my accurate informant about Danish public transportation! I love it!
31,Casper Jensen,3,"January 29, 2020",0,"Good, but not perfect. Leave 15-20 minutes before departure or you might miss your bus by 12 minutes..."
32,Vitalie Belinschi,3,"December 12, 2019",1,"The app is extremely useful, but it is eating my battery and I am afraid to use it. Everytime I open it, I go and force stop it, so that I don't have a dead battery. Otherwise very good app"
33,Erik Martin,3,"September 17, 2019",1,Does what it is meant to except when it doesn't. Doesn't update changes and delays as quick as it should. And I should not have to turn off my VPN everytime I want to check a timetable.
34,Andy Betony,1,"December 9, 2019",0,"Crashing, loosing tickets, horrible UI, not showing all the busses and charging you twice for 1 ticket. These are just some of the better features of this app. It's absolutely bloody use less!"
35,Michael El Kadiri,5,"November 12, 2019",0,Great in the first week of October. I will be frank because I did not know how to use but after a month and I use it alot Denmark you are a big country living here. But with this app I will like it my new phone game on how to get there and how to get back home.
36,Andreea Muscalagiu,1,"October 11, 2019",1,It happened several times in the past month that the app showed Certificate error (17) and therefore was completely unusable. Very unprofessional.
37,Pavel Zherdin,5,"November 6, 2019",3,time and time again i get white screen when opening the app after a while of inactivity. only phone restart helps. this is annoying when you're running late. reinstall helped.
38,Mikkel Gede Hansen,2,"December 25, 2018",1,"Crashes often, doesn't start half the time, no remember route or return function, inaccurate and odd routes, massive lack of quality of life...-in short this is your typical government made app. Jus t enough to barely function properly."
39,Rajmund Toth,1,"February 5, 2020",0,"First of all the name is misleading. A more descriptive name would be unrejse plan. If the intention was to show when the bus comes, well sometimes it does show... Anyway just throw everything away, hire real programmers and start from scratch."
40,Matthew Skowronski,4,"June 14, 2019",0,generally very good. It often doesn't update my real location which can be annoying but if you manually enter addresses it generally works well.
41,A Google user,5,"October 3, 2018",0,First class app for planning. Lots of information and updated in real time. Also allows ticket purchase in-app. Recommend this to anyone. HERNS
42,Peter Habel,2,"October 20, 2019",0,"The app is ok, but the shedule you are presented with is really unreliable and seem not be be updated realtime 😕 many times the app gives me a schedule and the station traffic information shows delayed or cancelled trains"
43,Dennis Skyum,1,"September 24, 2018",2,"""Live Map"" - right, I think this map must show traffic in some alternate dimension, because it sure doesn't show any real live traffic from this one."
44,Gyongyi Pedersen,1,"November 29, 2018",4,"I was in the Train in Kolding on my way to Billund airport, but any time I try to make a route plan the app did not recognised my location. Was offering me only far TOO LATE TIME, but not that one on which I was already involved"
45,codewing,5,"February 2, 2019",0,Great and easy to use. Buying a ticket could be easier but I only used the reisekort in the end anyway.
46,Vipin Sharma,5,"May 22, 2019",0,App works perfectly fine with quick navigation &amp; route information. I love it. Thank you.
47,Juan Manuel Cortez,4,"April 30, 2019",0,"Super awesome, only downside is it doesn't show which direction you are facing."
48,Steven Hubbard,1,"January 6, 2020",0,"Live map is useless. Either completely wrong, or doesn't work at all!"
49,Marian Pogor,5,"November 13, 2018",0,Very useful app. I am happy with because it's precisely and the path is very well explained.
50,Martin Vaňo,1,"January 6, 2020",1,Worked fine but now the app shows certificate error all the time
51,Henrik Boeck,4,"October 30, 2019",2,"Generally working well and easy to use, but sometimes not all travel options are included."
52,Kai Jung,3,"September 3, 2019",1,"The app is useful and mainly good, but changes/delays of trains, S-train and the Metro are very often not displayed."
53,Henrik Poulsen,1,"July 31, 2019",9,Uninstalling this now It has so far drained 6% of my battery today and I only briefly opened it this morning and has been doing rampant draining since this morning. wrote customer support a week or two ago and no answers. so have no choice but to remove it
54,Emma Holloway,5,"July 30, 2019",2,Tells me where I need to go clearly and quickly. This app is a total lifesaver when lost or if you're just trying to get around.
55,Paw Mullit,1,"September 23, 2019",1,Drained my battery completely! And it is faster to use a browser to access the normal website.
56,Priscille Malanda,1,"December 3, 2019",0,"As a student it's practical to be able to find a train to your destination /school. But the delays are horrible, and there isn't any other options available since I won't arrive at the same time, which equals me being late for school and that's messed up. There's a lot of missing signals, and since I have to take a train to a another train station, to afterwards take another bus/train because of the delays they won't wait even 5 minutes😠😠😠"
57,Svenja Weise,2,"July 1, 2019",2,"Many crashes. Can't find combinations of bus and train, works only for simple trips using one company."
58,Klaudijus,5,"August 15, 2019",6,"Amazing app, easy to use and has some extras build within. Loved it. helps everyday."
59,Myrto Ananida,4,"November 4, 2019",0,"Really good and precise app, but when there are delays, I would like it to give me an alternative route. :)"
60,Anto A.,4,"May 25, 2019",0,Really Good and precise info . does not get 5 stars because Gps navigation when on foot is a bit messy :)
61,Stuart Whyte,5,"August 28, 2019",2,Understands a huge number of search terms and provides detailed route plans which include live location mapping. Very stable and reliable.
62,A H,1,"December 17, 2019",0,"Doesnt show all departures. Often crash, and slow update on current shedule... DSB is rotten to the core..."
63,Lars Olsen,2,"May 25, 2019",1,"When you zoom in to read steet and place names, Google keeps minimising to the smallest possible font, hardly legible"
64,Yves Ruboneka,4,"December 5, 2018",0,"Sometimes, app's timeble does not match bus' timetable. Could be due to the bus' traffic issues."
65,Lotte Westerberg,5,"May 21, 2019",0,Easy to use. Can also tell you about delays or other changes about your trip.
66,Stephen Gardiner,4,"September 16, 2018",0,Works well and is stable. Quite flexible in routing options. Great work!

68,Jesus OnlySavior,4,"November 18, 2018",0,"Great App, just if they could make live bus, so that we can see where is the bus we have choosen"
69,Mm D,1,"December 5, 2019",3,After refusing my GPS location and access to my contacts - stuck on loading bar. Effectively forcing you to share private data or app won't work!

71,balaji sankaran,5,"November 6, 2018",0,"It works fantastic and helps easy navigation in new places. If this app can work offline, then would be fantastic."

74,Serban Nicola,1,"January 10, 2019",3,"Why is it so hard to update the schedule when there is something going on with the metro, buses and trains??? People might lose planes because of this"
75,Sammy Dawa,5,"October 9, 2019",1,A good app. Very helpful even to a new person to Denmark. Fantastic for planning journeys.
76,Robert Kok,4,"October 16, 2019",0,Excellent search and overviews. Results list should list end station/direction.
77,Samsonite Dove,3,"November 15, 2019",2,Generally excellent but often misses alternative and better route options.
78,Dolor Ante Lucem,1,"October 29, 2019",3,"Draining too much battery in the background, when i dont even use it - uninstalled."

86,Mozamel,4,"September 20, 2018",0,Nice app for planning trips and comparing travel options
87,Ágnes Szabó,3,"August 29, 2019",0,"The biggest disadvantage is that when I launch a search, in the results I am not getting the trantsport that are late shown as still available. Why do I need to do logistics to figure out the next bus???"
88,Gin 8330,2,"September 2, 2019",1,Information it is so confusing.... need much more simplicity and visual clarity..
89,Iranga Perera,4,"January 9, 2020",0,Easy and user friendly.

91,Ian Weaver,2,"August 19, 2019",2,"Delay handling for the buses is not accurate, and that's on Rejseplanen rather than the bus company as the bus stop itself has a more accurate feed"

Det fint nok at se hvilken bus man skal køre med i hvor langt tid, men vejen til busstoppested er besværligt at finde frem. Generelt når man vil få flere informationer omkring en rute så bliver det irriterende at finde det man vil.. Eneste grund hvorfor jeg bruger den, er fordi det hos mig er vejarbejde, ellers bruger jeg Google Maps, men den ved ikke at der er vejarbejde.

Er du kommet i god tid, så du faktisk kunne nå en tidligere afgang fra den første station, vil du måske hellere vente på den station, du skal skifte på, fremfor at tage den næste afgang, og risikere toget så er forsinket, så du ikke når det alligevel, men de ekstra afgange bliver ikke vist.

public transport every day"
476,QAK Video-Series,1,"June 5, 2018",5,"I am so disappointed by Denmark transport station, specially the behaviour

478,A Google user,1,"June 23, 2018",2,"This is retarded - even though the app can access the device's coordinates

mobile Internet."
479,Peter Harlund,1,"June 14, 2018",3,"Now they even removed information about the trip, so you don't know zones ,

498,Ben Camp,1,"May 13, 2018",2,"Pretty terrible app, crashes frequently especially when being used to

Feb.2015:Why copy iOS update and introduce lots of FAIL?  Why can't I pick ""Dansk"" as an option,  to avoid all the missing/wrong info in the half-assed ""English"" version?    Previous version was MUCH better."
549,A Google user,4,"February 18, 2018",0,"Very practical app which can show both planned and real schedule. Just one thing: sometimes rejseplanen cannot show all the routes while Google map can. The routes were available in reality but somehow ignored by this app, especially when searching a route with multiple exchange."
550,A Google user,4,"March 10, 2018",1,"A really handy and indispensable app if you use public transportation in Denmark. It does have a few issues. At times it seem hellbent on getting you to your destination by the most complicated set of routes, for instance. But my major complaint is, that you can't save your preferences with regards to means of transportation, and that teletaxi and -busses takes precedence over conventional bus lines making it seem impossible to get from point A to B!"
551,Stefan Dimitriu,4,"January 13, 2018",1,App that does what it was designed to do. I use it every time I have to go somewhere or I am unsure about the  timeline of my journey.
552,Theofanis Spanos,4,"March 8, 2018",1,"Great app, however it needs to handle delays and bus stop locations a bit better, if it aims for perfection. Often the bus stop is not where the app thinks it is, and the delays and longer than expected. However this is very likely not the apps fault, but the bus company's instead."
553,Gabriel Pincu,1,"February 24, 2018",0,"Maybe this program have virus because after i downloaded, my phone battery getting low very very fast and start to be hot. Be carreful because If You uninstall the app, problem remain the same until You full reset your phone."
554,Susanna Andreasi,4,"January 12, 2018",0,Very good app. Only two problems: it doesn't allow to paste any word in the places to and from. And there are no English translation of the information
555,John Hetner Henriksen,1,"August 29, 2019",1,"Virker fint til det den skal, men når jeg ikke har brugt appen i flere måneder og min tlf informerer mig at appen drainer mit batteri, så fortæller det mig at i har noget tracking igang eller lignende. Ikke noget som appen bør gøre. Afinstalleret."
556,Domas Trijonis,5,"February 14, 2018",2,"Covers my needs perfectly after last updates, I even found a widget. An option to collapse the header would be nice though."
557,A Google user,4,"December 21, 2017",0,It's helping me in my basic travelling.  Maybe I don't know all the possibility of this app.
558,Tanmay Bhowmik,4,"December 10, 2017",0,"Please add Zone information. Sometimes the app is not showing the correct status. Otherwise, it works fine for me."
559,Tor S,3,"February 1, 2018",1,Egentlig en pisse god app men den kan af uransagelige årsager ikke huske indstillingerne for gå hastighed og lignende. Det er pænt irriterende.
560,Rasmus Francke Harboe,1,"February 2, 2018",0,"I øjeblikket ubrugelig. Hver gang jeg prøver at finde en rejse, får jeg fejlmeddelelsen ""The request is invalid. (LOCATION)"""

562,Shahid Khan,4,"February 1, 2018",0,Its a good app but it must show exact timming sometimes departure is delayed and it shows wrong timing  Otherwise its a nice app.
563,A Google user,1,"November 9, 2018",0,"Viser generelt ikke alle rejsemuligheder eller afgange. Særligt problematisk i kombination med blå busser, da de oftest er forsinkede i morgen- og eftermiddagstimerne. Midlertidigt nedlagte stoppesteder og forsinkelser inddrages ikke i ruteplanlægningen, så du kan generelt set ikke regne med app'en."
564,Liliya Pavlova,5,"December 24, 2017",1,"I plan all my trips with the app. Apart from the bus schedule, it seems always up to date."
565,Michael Mullins,4,"March 5, 2018",0,Useful app for everyday use. Please add the havnebus as an easier option. The fastest route is not always the best.

567,Emilia Guerra Silva Sørensen,3,"February 14, 2018",0,"Jeg vef ikke hvad der sker for rejseplanen for tiden den foreslår at jeg står af stoppet før og går i 10 minutter istedet for at stoppe lige ude foran min lejlighed som normalt.

622,Jørgen B. Hovde,4,"August 13, 2017",8,"Very useful. But why is there no obvious way of saving individual journeys in the app? A problematic scenario seems to be planning a trip the night before leaving, and then finding the next day that the spesific trip/connections I was looking at has disappeared as the app has gone back to the ""search screen""."
623,A Google user,4,"July 3, 2017",6,"I like very much the app and I'm using it daily. The reason for giving it just 4 stars, is the fact that sometimes ""forgets"" to announce that a train/bus was delayed or cancelled. Or, if it does it, it's with around 15 min later after it was written that the train/bus was traveling properly."
624,Agata Wolska,4,"July 6, 2017",2,"I'm using it daily and all of the delays are showed. But delayed time is not updating next transport you should take, for example when you are not gonna catch next bus they are offering. Also sometimes it's not working at all, but just for a brief moment. Except that, it's very helpful"
625,Frederik Seidelin,2,"November 12, 2017",0,"Useful app and pretty fast and easy to use. Some of the English translations are a bit shoddy (to the point of being nonsensical), which really shouldn't be the case with a high-profile app such as this."

627,Yvor Broer,4,"September 11, 2017",0,Good and user friendly app. Only refreshes a bit too fast... by which half way your yourney the route dissappears and you have to search all over again.
628,Chris O Connor,2,"August 2, 2017",1,Would be great if the apps times matched the actual times the buses actually drive! 18 minutes difference sometimes! Just not good enough.
629,Zet Mech,4,"August 25, 2017",0,"Bruger den dagligt og er glad for at bruge den, bare en skam at Odense bustrafik er dårlige til at informere om evt. flyttelse af stoppesteder pga. vejafspærringer, som resulterer i et meget forvirrende program til tider."
630,Annette Stryhn,3,"July 3, 2017",0,"De nye farver er noget hø, og man skal stadig kende sin tur for at få alle resultater frem.  The new colours are not good and you still need to know your trip to get all the results that are available."

633,Dimitrios Bizopoulos,1,"November 29, 2017",0,i installed this app for the live map but it seems that live map gives positions of buses/trains etc with a delay of 10 min. this makes the app useless.
634,Henrik Stidsen,5,"July 5, 2017",1,"Muligvis den app jeg bruger oftest. Perfekt til at finde næste bus hjem, gør det markant nemmere at bruge offentlig transport."
635,mega nathan,5,"September 9, 2017",0,"Much needed app for travelling via public transport in Denmark. I would have rated 5 ,if the app has option of buying ticket directly instead of connecting to different app."
636,Bolog Andrei,4,"November 23, 2017",0,Sometimes when connecting from bus to train it dosen't factor a usual 2-3 bus delay. Also a bit hard to find the best route/closest station when traveling to a new place
637,Crystal Westrum,4,"September 18, 2017",0,Times aren't always right on my usual routes but otherwise it's good.
638,Felix Fleischhauer,4,"December 5, 2017",0,"Works well, it just sometimes does not update cancellation or delay of trains / busses fast enough and does not allow you to save a journey"
639,Sebastian Melchior Lind,1,"September 10, 2017",0,"Denne App er ikke kun dårlig, men giver dig falske info, har selv lige planlagt ud fra hvad appen fortalte mig, pg må som konsekvens vente i en time, og komme en time for sent på arbejde"

Det er en helt anden ting... der er fejl i appen og det er som sådan ok en gang imellem for jeg bruger den ikke hver dag, men når jeg så gør og jeg er et sted jeg aldrig har taget offentligt før/ikke ved hvor stationen er så kan den ikke vise mig til stationen.."

Jeg kan se nogle brugere bliver nervøse over app'ens permissions - det er nok som led i en større sammensværgelse der trækker tråde dybt ind i folketinget, og to år fra nu ligger du nok bagbundet i en stjålet Skoda på en øde polsk landevej, din konto lænset, din familie afpresset, din hund aflivet. At du overhovedet har en mobil med internetadgang og gps er en kæmpe brøler, det er sådan de tracker dig og forbereder magtovertagelsen.  Træd varsomt. Over and out."

I can't give full marks to an app with no settings options. Crazy that I must keep changing the sorting order from line to time and have no way of saving my preferences. That is an oversight that could easily be fixed. Good developers trust users to be able to tweak apps to work for them. Those who designed rejseplanen thought they knew better. Not so. Always provide options for users to change settings and save them if you want to write a top rated app."

Understøtter også landscape på alle menuer.  Dog har jeg oplevet flere gange, at rejseplanens servere ikke har svaret, når jeg har søgt på forbindelser på det sidste. Stadig kilometer foran størstedelen af de andre apps jeg har prøvet!"

""Per Jensen"" is easier to remember and write than ""Ringstedvej 253, 4130 Roskilde"" to take a fake example. (2) Sync frequently used addresses between devices (tall order, I know, but would be very useful, especially on small mobile phones)."

Mon det overhovedet er lovligt at acceptere det uden deres accept også det er vel at give jer tilladelser til dokument falskneri.
