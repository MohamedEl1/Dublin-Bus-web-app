0,Roberto Mariuccini,5,"February 4, 2020",5,"Recently stopped working, db won't update, anyway most stops haven't changed but the App won't find them. E g. most stops for route 27 (Dublin Bus displays them correctly). Edit: I confirm the app is working well again. 5 stars for the effort. Thanks. P.S.: I once used the feedback link inside the app, but got ignored :)"
1,maggo bomber aggie,3,"May 21, 2020",1,"I think that it's about time Dublin Bus have an app for the people who can time when their bus is due, and it's 95% right on schedule well depending on the traffic."
2,Jason Thomas,4,"February 3, 2020",3,"It's a fairly reliable application, and covers all the routes I can think of. It doesn't tell you when the bus is late, but blame that on Dublin Bus."
3,Shunyata Records,5,"February 3, 2020",3,This app has always helped me. Accurately telling the bus times. Great to have it.
4,Elaine Kelly,4,"January 29, 2020",2,Worth a try. The buses arrive as advertised. The screens are easy to navigate. Nice colour scheme.
5,Laura D,4,"January 29, 2020",0,Great app. Includes both Dublin Bus and Go Ahead and much better than any of the official apps.
6,jennifer maguire,5,"January 31, 2020",0,Very impressed with this app and the high level of service provided by our bus drivers ..üöå:)
7,martin carolan,5,"March 26, 2020",0,"Great saves a lot of wasted time,plan trips better"
8,Paige,4,"March 9, 2020",3,"Sometimes doesn't sync with Go Ahead routes, but definitely a better alternative to the official Dublin Bus app."
9,Fran√ßois A.,5,"January 27, 2020",0,Nice app. Enjoying features in latest update. Thanks!
10,Gerard Wheatley,3,"February 13, 2020",0,"I find the app does exactly what I want, tells me time of next bus."
11,Maurice Ginty,5,"March 9, 2020",0,Very easy to use and reliable.
12,–ù–∞—Ç–∞–ª–∏—è –°—É–¥–∞—Ä–∏–∫–æ–≤–∞,5,"February 26, 2020",0,"A very good app, very useful."
13,Brian MacDiarmuide,5,"June 11, 2020",0,Much more like what the official app shhould be. Thanks!
14,A Google user,5,"January 21, 2019",4,"Very strong app, compared to the last one the built in features are great. The tracking of a bus in 5 minute intervals so you've time to walk to the bus stop, the option between minute countdown and arrival time, filtering buses and also the fact when tracking a bus it'll automatically close the push bar notifications. A wonderful app upgrade and it's much stronger utilisation of Dublin bus scheduling. Do buses go missing? Yes I've had one. But I don't believe it's the apps fault."
15,nicola giraldi,5,"October 2, 2019",2,"Great app, use it on a daily basis to go to work and pick up my daughter. Unfortunately though, the past 2 days not one bus stop or timetable has worked properly on the app, it just says no buses were found. I've tried updating the bus routes through the app and I tried reinstalling the app also but still no times appear. A fix for this would be great as the official bus app is really bad and this one has a lot of handy features."
16,Verl√©in Mc Kiernan,5,"November 23, 2018",0,"Great app, so much better than the official app. The only issue I have is when I click on the notification for the bus tracker, it doesn't bring up the bus stop where that bus will be arriving, only the main page of my favourite stops. Normally this is okay because I can just hit my saved stop, but sometimes when I am tracking a bus at a stop I don't usually use and don't know the number of, I have to go to the route, find the stop and then I can see where the bus is at (and if there are any sooner, as Dublin bus is liable to do!) if this was fixed it would be be super useful."
17,Evelyn Balfe,5,"January 18, 2020",0,This app was fab. But lately it keeps coming up RETRY. i really depend on this app working. Please fix it. Aƒ∫l my friends are experiencing this problem and we are all OAP.
18,Brendan Fahy,5,"December 19, 2019",0,"Much better than the official app. It's a pity it still has to work use the same (terrible) API/data source, but it's still a vast improvement!"
19,karen lynch,4,"August 23, 2019",0,The only thing I do not like with the app is: since the 76 busses changed over I have noticed that when I time one it would either arrive much earlier than it should (I end up missing it) or not arrive at all. This is the reason for giving it the 4 star's üåü but other than that I do recommend downloading the app.
20,Conor Murphy,4,"March 8, 2019",9,"Absolute legend of an app. FAR better than the official app both in design and functionality  Only thing that would stop me from making it 5 stars would be publication in Fdroid (would be extra sound of the Dev, not that he isn't already)  I am thinking about getting a phone that runs Ubuntu Touch in the future, so if he wants to be extra EXTRA sound (I know I am just being cheeky at this stage)"
21,Nicole Higgins,5,"March 4, 2019",0,"Very useful and much user friendly tha real DB app. There is a favourite tab, search and news tab. on the search tab you can type the bus number, address or bus stop which is very handy. It shows both Dublin bus AND TFI buses on it whereas Dublin Bus app won't show 17a on it since it's been taken over by TFI, which is great for me as I usr the 17a bus and their real time info isn't properly up and running yet. The news tab just has recent tweets from Db and TFI."
22,F H,5,"February 6, 2019",0,"this app does everything the Dublin bus app does, with some of the same issues the Dublin bus app has unfortunately. i gave the Dublin bus app 4 stars and this got 1 extra because it has more features, like being able to name bus stops you have saved to favourites, having the go ahead operated routes available in real time. also it let's you track as many buses as you want with audible reminders so you don't need to keep opening or refreshing the app and it doesn't crash when viewing the map"
23,Eli M,5,"June 4, 2019",19,"I had the same idea for an application, I started active development 1 month ago, then I discovered this yesterday. Tried it today, it does everything I intended to implement (tracking bus and making it alert you when it's near), you invalidated my efforts, but thank you, this will be very useful."
24,Ernest Alilovic,2,"October 30, 2019",0,"Worked fine for a while (not accurate all the time), but I haven't been able to get information on any of my local buses for at least a week now. Even if I see the bus arriving at the station, the app still shows nothing. Google Maps has proven more accurate, so I'm using that instead."
25,A Google user,1,"February 11, 2019",3,If your only function is realtime. You should probably be able to get it right. Times for buses bounce all over the place. been using it for a month and using it to time the most predictable bus routes and you still cant rely on it. In fact it actually hinders you because of the sudden changes.
26,Jonathan Fagan,1,"January 16, 2019",11,This app is the worst app ever. I have missed numerous amounts of bus over it's terrible accuracy of timing the bus. another feature which is tracking the bus is a waste of time cause it tells you the bus arrives in 10 minutes but is actually way earlier. If I could give it 0 stars I would. absolutely infuriating app.
27,Dave Ward,5,"June 6, 2019",7,much better than rhe Dublin Bus app. very responsive which is vitally important for an app of this nature. it has all the features I can think of and the ability to rename stops is great as I can rename stops across the road from one another and not need to remember the stop number. class app.
28,Paul Rafferty,2,"December 15, 2018",14,"Unreliable. Not sure if it's the fault of Dublin bus data feedor this app. The (crappy) Dublin Bus realtime information website is correct while this app is not. This doesn't show an 18 bus for 25 minutes, the website says there'll be one in 2 minutes."
29,Kyleee McCann,5,"December 7, 2018",12,"On some stops that I use there is no way to tell what bus is coming for example 41, 41b If it is possible to be able to add which bus is exactly coming (ie where they originate from) I would be over the moon. Love the app been using it ever since I found it."
30,zolaman1000,4,"December 10, 2018",4,I've installed the app on my new phone but it's not as quick loading as in my last phone. When I check a bus time and check it again I have to come out of the app altogether and go back in as it takes to long to load or it doesn't load at all
31,Eimear O' Farrell,5,"June 8, 2019",2,"Excellent app, does exactly what I need and has the option to favourite stops, which the other app got rid of. The bus alarm is great too. Arrival times are vert accurate too, if only the buses themselves arrived on time."
32,Lamiya Basheer,3,"October 14, 2019",1,"Timings are almost accurate, and they even have some specific routes which are missing in the Dublin Bus app. BUT, the server is down atleast once or twice in a week, urgently when I go and check a bus from the stop. It says a Retry."
33,Paul Carkery Moggy Arts,4,"July 29, 2019",10,"Great App for Everyone who needs to know about the next bus availability and also about the routes they take, this one uses map based data for bus routes. I'd recommended this app to all people who need public transport to get from A to B..."
34,McLovin,4,"November 1, 2019",3,"Used to work great. But is of no use for over a month since now I am getting the No buses were found error when I select my stop. It is working for some stops, but bot the stops I want. Update - it works after the update"
35,Ronan Hickey,2,"October 23, 2018",2,Used new app once and bus times were wrong so ended up missing a bus and having to wait for ages. Kept changing the time of next bus so could not rely on it. Where has official Dublin bus app gone as that used to work great but not on Google play any longer
36,Michael Harraghy,1,"February 18, 2020",1,Awful can't find buses anywhere
37,Eadaoin Hayes,5,"December 28, 2019",0,Much more user friendly than real time Ireland. Has go ahead and Dublin bus times. Would be super if timetables were included.
38,Saoirse Cheng,1,"December 6, 2019",1,I use this app everyday for work as it has both Dublin Bus and Go Ahead buses on it but for the past week now none of the Go Ahead buses (the 76 in my case) have been showing up on it. Ive emailed both Go Ahead and the NTA and they said they're working on it but it's still the same?
39,Ciara Duffy,5,"October 29, 2018",0,App is great. Perfect to the minute. And have never had a problem. Able to get across the city so fast because i can see exact times
40,Emma C,3,"October 16, 2019",0,Loved it but now it's saying no busses are calling for stops 145 stops into town. When a friend I was with check the TFI app it have real time data so switching to that one. Pity because I prefer this app's layout.
41,Richard Thompson,5,"September 22, 2018",10,"After emailing the developer regarding crashing issue, the next day a new update came out. Now able to open app, great response, great app, great team, many thanks."
42,Sayonara Bittencourt,3,"May 10, 2019",0,More than once the app showed buses that either never came or were not on time. I can't seem to be able to just pick the stop by near me as well. Once I figure this out I'll change my review.
43,Toby Gamr,5,"October 9, 2018",6,"So much better than the original. Recommendation: Make the ""Due in"" timer continue to run when the app is swiped from recents. This app puts the official one to shame, good job man üëå"
44,Paul Byrne,5,"December 28, 2018",2,Great app. Easy to use and reliable. Having the option to set a reminder when your bus is a certain time away is terrific.
45,Clodagh Kett,3,"October 14, 2019",0,"Worked quite well before and was very handy but since has stopped working, saying there is no available buses for this stop or something! So switched to Dublin bus pal instead, will see how get on."
46,Deirdre Mcgovern,2,"December 16, 2019",1,"I always use this app+rely on it. I usually find it very good, but the last few days a message keeps coming up saying that the app keeps stopping."
47,Sarah Malone,1,"October 27, 2019",0,"I have updated this app today and I still get ""Could not find a bus calling at this stop"" for bus stops that used to work fine. I will have to use a different app..."
48,patrick Egan,5,"January 3, 2020",0,I've always found this app to be very accurate and useful. I've been using it for years and very happy with it
49,Priyanka Athavale,5,"August 20, 2019",5,Really good app. Works smoothly and the layout is easy to maneuver. It's very handy to track my bus especially because that route is not very frequent.
50,Ugo Uzoukwu,5,"August 28, 2019",2,This app is awesome! I love the material design throughout the app and its got all the features you need. The alert is my favourite
51,A Google user,1,"October 15, 2019",1,"Back to square one. Can't check times for last couple of days, only on selected bus stops working. It is not helpful at all!"
52,Jennifer Corrigan,5,"October 17, 2019",19,Excellent app. Very accurate. Love how you can track a bus and love how it connects to my fitbit versa watch. It gives minute to minute updates on the bus I am tracking on my watch. So handy!
53,najm lion,5,"October 15, 2018",0,"Great app, use it everyday. Reliable, fast, efficient. Nothing to complaint about really."
54,Suhas J,5,"November 17, 2018",1,This is what I was looking for and this app has all the features and it's better than the official Dublin bus app. Thanks and Cheers to the Team...
55,Ray Adamson,5,"December 7, 2018",4,Excellent app. Easy to use. Ability to create an alert is awesome. Thanks.
56,Ivo Specht,4,"January 27, 2019",4,"great app for day to day live in Dublin. One thing I'd appreciate dearly would be a ""start journey at x time"" feature for bus stops - or have i just not found that yet?"
57,Mark Stapleton,5,"December 30, 2018",5,"Very good app. Use it every day. The times are decently accurate, they use the Dublin Bus or TFI times. Waaaayy nicer than the official app."
58,d sheridan,5,"May 29, 2019",1,"very good, once the website app collapsed but apart from that, it has been very accurate and helpful."
59,Rumble,5,"February 22, 2019",8,"This app is good and you could say better than the original because you can be notified about a bus you choose to be coming, and change the bus stop names so they arent confusing and you know where they are"
60,Angelica Hernandez,5,"July 27, 2019",0,"Very good app, accurate information of all the bus routes in Dublin, totally reliable. I highly recommend it."
61,Helen McHugh,4,"November 15, 2019",0,Very good but not always accurate. Can say a bus is expected and then the bus can vanish from the list.
62,A Google user,5,"December 10, 2018",0,Great and useful app for people who often use public transport usually very accurate and helpful. Highly recommend!!!
63,Suzanne Gallagher,5,"November 18, 2018",1,"Very user friendly from a visiually impaired user""s perspective. Easy to read the realtimes at a glance and quick uploading of bus estimated arrival."
64,Adam,5,"November 5, 2018",2,"Brilliant app! So grateful that you added support for the Go Ahead routes, there was no reliable app for them times."
65,Ray Coz,5,"May 29, 2019",2,"Excellent app, shows both dublin bus and go ahead buses at the stops and shows the routes of the buses. A real time-saver"
66,John Lando,4,"August 31, 2019",0,Very good app once you've figured out your way around it. Gotta it's an actual improvement from the last one.
67,G db,3,"December 5, 2019",0,"Great app, but the Go Ahead buses seem to have disappeared again in the last few days. I have the most recent version."
68,George Syrtsov,5,"August 5, 2019",1,"Complete 5 stars! I've never had a problem with this app, accurate times all the time!!"
69,Aleksei Chuvakov,5,"October 3, 2019",0,"This app gives very accurate data, even better than tableaus on bus stations. Haven't noticed any glitches since I use it. Hood app."
70,M LastV,3,"February 13, 2019",24,it's OK but old DB app was better 4 me.in this one missing time table and also must to keep in mind under which bus stop no.is bus no.to till I open.in old version was bus no.1st then u open it and was stop no and u can add to ur favorite both.Bus no.and bus stop no.
71,John Raphael Augustine Martha O' Leary,5,"July 23, 2019",0,love this updated version of the TFI APP. print is much larger Great (UI). user interface. Overall a great experience. Thank you TFI
72,Oisin Gough,5,"August 27, 2019",1,"Much better then the original app, and the track the bus option is dead handy gives you a little 5 minute alarm reminder for when your bus is due,"
73,Mary Alagna,3,"June 10, 2019",1,"looks ok so far. if you can add a 'favorite stops' section, that'd be amazing. Dublin bus screwed their app up bigtime. Thanks for making this one!"
74,Michelle Teelan,5,"April 30, 2020",0,Yep always on time happy with this app üòä
75,Rafael De Souza Pinheiro,5,"December 23, 2019",0,Very helpful when does not have screens on the bus stop
76,Frank Courtney,5,"September 22, 2018",2,Great App - very useful and easy to use (had a minor glitch - very quickly fixed by the developer)
77,Timothy TEo,4,"September 11, 2019",0,"Very good, very accurate bus timings. Easy to understand UI and search function is well implemented."
78,cbreeze,4,"September 25, 2019",0,Cant figure out how to reorder the favourites and how to refresh the times. I have accidentally deleted one or two. I like the way you can change to arrival time from minutes to go
79,colm brennan,5,"October 6, 2019",0,Great app! Always works and he's managed to integrate the two companies which transport for Ireland have never managed to do
80,Glen Allen,1,"November 9, 2019",0,"Doesn't work anymore.. keeps showing 'no buses at selected stop', same result at every stop. Otherwise it was good."
81,Maurice Gavin,5,"March 6, 2019",0,Streets ahead of the official Dublin Bus app. The real time data is often incorrect or wrong but that's down Dublin Bus's unreliable API.
82,J√©r√©mie Dautry,5,"June 10, 2019",1,If only Dublin Bus or TFI could come up with an app like this one. Amazingly intuitive and user-friendly!
83,A Google user,5,"March 7, 2019",0,A must have App for frequent users of Public transport in Dublin. The tracking feature is particularly useful when you are in a pub!
84,Suzy H,5,"March 12, 2019",0,accurate information. very useful when using routes where the service is infrequent.
85,Craig Turpin,3,"November 7, 2018",1,It's very slow and sometimes says that real time info.is unavailable. Isn't that one of the big selling points of the app?
86,Jose Jr,5,"October 3, 2019",0,It's a great app u have many options and it helps me a lot it tells the exact time every time.
87,Erica Lj Hewitt,3,"October 16, 2019",0,"It's a great app but dosnt work for me anymore, everytime I press onto a stop number it says theres no available times for the stop so I'm uninstalling"
88,Mary Ruttledge,5,"October 17, 2019",0,I don't use the bus very often and therefore never remember the times. So it's very convenient for me. Thank you.
89,Chlo√© Emma,4,"December 16, 2019",2,"Perfect except for, I would like to know why certain buses aren't available ( if they were cancelled for example)"
90,Rira Hanlon,5,"January 6, 2020",0,Very simple to use for someone only needs the bus when car is broken
91,Reece0101,5,"June 2, 2019",1,"Genuine good app that tells you time of bus, must say better than the official Dublin Bus and TFI. I know ot doesn't give the accurate tome because of TFI but it shows bus's not on the other timetables"
92,Valerie Keeley,1,"April 16, 2019",9,never goes by the time table says bus will be here in three minutes at bus stop and no bus says due no bus then comes up 24 minutes for the next one so either the bus came early which I've notice that happens a lot since you have took over or didn't come at all there not going by the time on the app !
93,Ines C,1,"November 17, 2018",0,"This app doesn't work, I tried using it several times and it would just crash every single time."
94,Dara Breathnach,5,"August 2, 2019",0,"Excellent app, streets ahead of the NTA one. Has information for routes Dublin Bus lost and for which their own app no longer provides info."
95,Michael Clarke,4,"February 18, 2020",0,I think go ahead buses have gone missing?
96,Davide Sgobba,5,"December 4, 2019",0,"Very easy to use and reliable app, With all the information you need. News from Dublin bus keeps you updated. 5 stars"
97,Philip Anthony Kenny,3,"June 8, 2019",4,The times can be hugely inaccurate. i left for my bus at 15 45 thinking I'd be waiting 5 mins and the bus i was waiting for didn't turn up til 16 30? How does the app get the times wrong by that wide a margin?
98,I√±aki Serraller Vizcaino,5,"January 20, 2020",0,Use it every day and it works pretty well. Favourites is very convenient.
99,Cintia Silva,4,"March 20, 2019",1,"accurate most of the time...really easy to use , much better than the official dublin bus app. I would def recommend."
100,Martin Talbot,1,"April 13, 2019",5,If I could give this app less than one star I would. Seems every other bus it lists doesn't exist and never shows up. I know the real Dublin bus app does the same but it's still not acceptable
101,Vincent Murtagh,5,"May 25, 2019",0,Buses normally arrive at times indicate. App is a super help for me a frequent user of buses.
102,Fustard ButtBurger,4,"September 9, 2019",0,"Works pretty well, GUI needs a little work but works almost perfect."
103,Have Fun,1,"November 17, 2018",0,The app was working a little bit but now it crashes whenever I try to search a bus stop
104,Maire Hicks,5,"February 23, 2019",0,"one of the best bus apps ive used,the buses always arrive on time,its very user friendly and i definitely recommend it to anyone, thank you"

106,Cormac Phelan,5,"November 29, 2018",0,Excellent app with a lovely user interface. Much better than the official version.
107,Mary Burke,5,"October 18, 2019",1,Marvelous App. Bus always arrives on time except when the Drivers get stuck in traffic or are diverted. Love this App
108,Becky Tyrrell,5,"September 16, 2018",0,Great because it shows you what the stop looks like so you know you're on the right one!
109,Darren McManus,5,"September 28, 2018",0,Great app much better than all the other ones it's the only one that is reliable all the rest don't work like this app

115,renniks,5,"April 4, 2019",2,"Very handy having both companies routes, with a slick layout. Useful being able to see the stops listed on the map too"
116,Dylan Montello,5,"June 21, 2019",0,Its alot easier to find the bus stops and information about the bus stop which is why i rate this a 5 star üåü
117,Johnny Patterson,2,"October 14, 2019",2,Why does this app not show buses anymore? Worked great until a few weeks ago.
118,colin mifsud,5,"November 9, 2019",1,You can customise the names of your favourite stops which is a big plus when you have a lot of favourites
119,Nigel Higgins,5,"February 15, 2020",0,Works much better than the official app.
120,Paul Kinsella,5,"February 6, 2019",0,Great this App has RTI for Routes recently transferred to Go-Ahead Ireland like the 104 and 17A as well as Dublin Bus.
121,A Google user,5,"October 19, 2018",0,It's a really good app always shows the time right for the bus thanks

124,Suzanne C.,1,"September 24, 2019",6,New update is really bad. Bus keep going missing even tho its there on the list or it just search wont work at all.
125,Peter Merrigan,5,"August 27, 2019",0,"Great app, it does all the buses where as before I had to use 2 apps, thank üòâü§ò"

128,Lorenzo Penati,4,"June 9, 2019",0,Quite essential (good thing) and generally works well.
129,Krutika Singh,4,"June 14, 2019",0,Much better than Dublin bus app and also shows quiet accurate bus timings. üëç

133,Ciara Keane,2,"November 14, 2018",1,"The real time seems to be about 3-4 mins wrong, keep missing all my buses! Not reliable at all"

Clearing cache as another reviewer suggested does not help. Doing a bit of digging it seems to  be a null pointer error while attempting to read a string:   java.lang.RuntimeException: Could not dispatch event: class com.nextbus.dublin.b.e to handler [EventHandler public void com.nextbus.dublin.activity.BusTimesActivity.onStopRoutesDownloaded(com.nextbus.dublin.b.e)]: Attempt to invoke virtual method 'boolean java.lang.String.equalsIgnoreCase(java.lang.String)' on a null object reference"

630,Edwina McManus,4,"June 21, 2017",6,It is great app keeps me informed of realtime information when at a stop that has none. It is a little frustrating when it doesnt work and no realtime information is available.  Other than that you know when your next bus will be so you will never miss your bus.

635,Denise Amon,5,"June 8, 2017",1,Very good app. Love the fact that it shows your location and shows all the bus stops of a specific bus. Presenting the arrival time into minutes is also a big plus!
636,Conor Donelan,5,"July 11, 2017",0,"Great app thank you, my only addition to it would be a little reminder function: as in you select the bus you want to get and it sends you a notification when it's a specified time from arrival. That would be awesome.  Edited to make it five stars after your reply. Thanks for getting back to me. Best of luck!"

671,Derek Bray,4,"June 14, 2018",0,"App is accurate 90% of the time, the other 10% could be to do with the data

687,Roger Savage,1,"December 21, 2016",10,"Have this app a long time. Fantastic when it started out but now has what only be called phantom buses, time changes that only Doctor Who could make and huge delays. I wouldn't go with the Dublin Bus timetable either! After holding the country to ransom this year they seem to come and go as they please. Time to buy a car!!!"

689,Marcin Wysocki,3,"February 21, 2017",0,Just a suggestion: the app needs something like a home button to easy go back to the home screen. The apps always opens on the last viewed stop (which makes total sense) and sometimes you have to tap back button multiple times to go back to the list of favourite stops. Home button would resolve this

696,A Google user,4,"April 6, 2017",0,"Great app. I like the design and all the features it offers. I really find useful the way it shows the bus route on the map and allows you to click on a bus stop to see the timing. Great work! I only see a feature missing: when I add a favourite bus stop, the only way to edit the name is to remove the favourite and add it again. By doing so, if I had a name already I have to write it again. Thanks"

It would be great if it would alarm you when your end stop is coming too for when your taking a bus for the first time. Also would be great if it gave you an estimated arrival time. Other features such as journey planner would be great too."

You open the app, try to scroll down to your route and just as you hit the screen an ad pops up and you are sent somewhere you don't want to be.  Now it's started on the top of the list of bus stops page. You try to hit the top one but a one line ad pops up while the list of bus stops moves down. Very sneaky."

1075,A Google user,5,"September 9, 2011",0,"One of the very best and most useful apps I‚Äôve downloaded. It‚Äôs great to now be waiting for a bus that I know is coming, rather than one that might be coming. Bus arrival times work very well. Nearest stop to me with info is 10 mins towards town, but if I use that stop and then deduct 10 mins I get very accurate info for my nearest stop. Joe D."
1076,A Google user,4,"October 25, 2011",1,Crap
1077,A Google user,5,"July 15, 2011",0,Use scroll-bar instead of page numbers for selecting stop numbers. Gps+maps showing bus locations &amp; bus numbers would be good. Would pay for that!

1094,Rob McCormack,5,"April 20, 2018",1,"Developer is super responsive, app receives regular updates, the paid version is one of the best apps I've ever paid for - the layout of the app is excellent, easy links to the actual bus routes &amp; stops, and a lovely option to track a specific bus and set an alarm when it's X minutes away from the stop.... in every possible way, this is a far superior app to the ""official"" app (which hasn't had an update in aeons)   Massive Kudos Stephen! If you can find a way for it to talk to Google Assistant/Google Home (it's crazy I can't ask my Google Home when the next bus is due outside my house) I think my life would be complete :)"

1096,Neil O'Boidic√¨n,5,"October 4, 2017",0,"Much better than Dublin bus app. Would suggest app opens on home page or favourites as default. Currently opens on last looked which is a tiny bit annoying, because you are most likely to be looking at a stop on your return journey and have to back back which usually ends up closing the app.  Thumbs up though. Well done"
1097,Bernard Mckeever,5,"November 5, 2015",0,"Developer responded immediately when emailed about issues I'd had on my oneplus two. App now working as perfectly as it had done before.  If you use Dublin bus at ALL, this the app for you. Great!"
